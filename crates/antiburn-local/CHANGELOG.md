# Changelog — antiburn-local

Changes to the local engine crate, released under `antiburn-local-v*` tags. The
desktop application has its own changelog at the repository root.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The audience here is different from the application's: this file is read by
somebody who depends on the crate from their own code, so it states API and
behaviour changes — including anything that moves the local boundary, the
discovery roots, or the persistence and export contracts, each of which is
a compatibility fact rather than a feature note.

`.github/workflows/release-engine.yml` reads the section matching the tagged
version and refuses the release if there is none.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `AgentKind::MistralVibe` and `SourceFormat::MistralVibeUnifiedStoreV1`.
  Discovery reads `~/.vibe/logs/session/unified/<session-id>`, honouring
  `VIBE_HOME`; the `session_logging.save_dir` config key and `child-*`
  subagent stores are not discovered. The reader validates the store format
  pinned in `CURRENT` (`mistral.vibe.unified-session-store/v1`, minor 7),
  takes the session identity and working directory from `meta.json`, the
  cumulative token totals from the newest journal projection state, tool
  executions from tool intents, and the model alias and reasoning effort from
  the newest generation `runtime-state.json`. Unknown store formats and
  journal rows fail closed. Model-overthinking and old-model findings are
  allowed; request-scoped checks, subagent facts, and clean results are not.

### Added

- Add `AgentKind::Omp` and `SourceFormat::OmpV3Jsonl`. Discovery reads
  `~/.omp/agent/sessions`, honouring `PI_CONFIG_DIR` and the default-profile
  `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`; named profiles and XDG redirects are not discovered.
  The reader drops the fixed-width 256-byte title slot, requires an exact
  version 3 header, and admits only the OMP core (`message` with role `user`,
  `assistant`, `toolResult`, or `bashExecution`, `model_change`,
  `thinking_level_change`, and `compaction`) before the shared Pi-family
  scaffolding handles the row. Pi-only rows and other OMP record types stay
  unrecognized. Session-overdepth, model-overthinking, and old-model findings
  are allowed; overpowered-subagent and clean results are not.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- `QuotaIncident` carries an optional `reset_clock` (new `QuotaResetClock`
  type): the wall-clock reset time and IANA zone that a Claude limit-error
  message states in free text. The engine does not resolve it to an instant.
  Advance the evidence schema revision to 21 so existing stored analyses
  reparse to populate the field.
- Add the public named-resource verification API for unused MCP servers,
  built-in tools, and skills: `NamedResourceVerificationTarget`,
  `NamedResourceObservation`, `NamedResourceEvidence`,
  `NamedResourceAssessment`, and `verify_named_resource_watch`. A watch is
  verified against a complete, bounded later inventory from the same agent,
  source, and project scope.
- Add the public `ResourceTokenBurnAssessment` and
  `fallback_token_burn_basis_points` so a detector with findings but no
  attributable token evidence reports a conservative, bounded burn estimate
  instead of none.
- Remediation prompts now reach Cursor, Copilot, Cline, Kiro, Amp, and
  Windsurf sources. Before this, those agents never matched a recommendation
  or a source in the remediation path.
- Pi sessions with header version 1 or 2 are accepted in addition to
  version 3, applying Pi's documented read-time migrations. The reader also
  recognizes `usage`, `branch_summary`, and `label` records and the `system`,
  `custom`, `branchSummary`, and `compactionSummary` message roles.
- Cursor agent-transcript sessions now extract tool calls and full turn
  content, not only metrics events. Cursor subagent forks are linked at full
  confidence from the `agent-transcripts/<parent>/subagents/<child>.jsonl`
  path convention and from `subagentInfo.parentAgentId` in `store.db`.
- OpenCode SQLite sources are accepted when the `session`, `message`, or
  `part` tables omit `time_created` or `time_updated`; ordering falls back
  to the other timestamp column or row identity.
- Codex sessions that revert a fork at the top level resolve ownership from
  the copied parent metadata and the first later envelope timestamp. The
  reader treats `inter_agent_communication`, `web_search_begin`, and
  `web_search_end` as proven records and reads the context-window size from
  `/payload/model_context_window` as well as `/payload/info/model_context_window`.
- Claude `fork-context-ref` records and `system` records with subtype
  `away_summary`, `stop_hook_summary`, or `turn_duration` are recognized
  instead of being treated as inert.
- Antigravity reads model changes from CLI `USER_INPUT`
  `<USER_SETTINGS_CHANGE>` metadata and flags records with a non-empty
  `truncated_fields` list as partial.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `EfficiencyReport::estimated_token_burn_with_resource_tokens_by_session`
  is removed. Use
  `EfficiencyReport::estimated_token_burn_for_active_detectors(active_detector_mask, resource_assessments)`,
  which recomputes aggregate and per-detector burn for a selected set of
  detectors from `ResourceTokenBurnAssessment` values without exposing
  session-level token data.
- `CopilotCliJsonl` no longer claims a clean result for unused MCP servers,
  built-in tools, or skills, and no longer produces `SessionsOverDepth`
  findings. The accepted Copilot CLI bundle carries no resource-inventory or
  request-depth evidence to support them.

### Fixed

- Amp thread parsing double-counted cache-creation tokens inside
  `inputTokens`. Amp now reports `input_tokens` net of `cacheCreationTokens`,
  reconciles against `totalInputTokens` with the shared context-token
  accounting, and claims `SourceCapabilities::request_context_tokens`.
- Cursor discovery no longer overwrites an embedded fork observation with the
  weaker title-based heuristic.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Add bounded analysis for AMP v39 full-export thread JSON and Devin Local
  migration-17 SQLite sessions. AMP provides session-overdepth and old-model
  usage findings; Devin provides overpowered-subagent findings and can use
  optional ACP child context. Neither source can claim a clean result.
- Add `KiroCliV3Bundle` and `CopilotCliBundle` raw-source inputs, plus the
  `DevinLocalSqlite` source format and source-version fingerprints.
- Add the public `WorkMode`, `ModeSample`, and `mode_samples` API for assigning
  added tokens to the work modes observed in each assistant turn.

### Changed

- Advance parser, evidence, and coverage revisions to 39, 20, and 6. Existing
  stored analyses reparse under the new contracts.
- Keep partial or unsupported source evidence from claiming a clean result,
  and fingerprint the accepted Devin SQLite and companion inputs so content
  changes invalidate prior work.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- Remediation prompts now require the cause and target setting to be proved
  before an edit is applied, and ask agents to label hypotheses when evidence
  is incomplete.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- `Bucket` carries the estimated USD cost of its events, by component
  (`Bucket::cost`), inclusive of sub-agent events in merged metrics. Advance
  metrics schema revision to 9 so stored analyses rerun to populate it.

- Unused MCP servers, built-in tools, and skills can produce scoped advisory
  findings from complete resource evidence. Advisory findings support bounded
  remediation prompts and verification without claiming a whole session is
  clean. Built-in tool findings now exclude required and situational tools.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Bucket` has a new `cost` field, and
  `built_in_tool_remediation_supported` now requires an `AgentKind` argument
  so support is checked against the agent's tool catalog.
- **Breaking:** `EfficiencyReport` gains private report-time resource-token
  attribution fields. Code that constructs this public struct directly must
  update its construction path.
- **Breaking:** per-bucket pricing state is included in resume snapshots;
  advance the resume snapshot revision to 11. The metrics schema revision is 9.
- Remediation prompts can contain up to 64 KiB. Resource findings identify
  advisory targets with an empty session ID and expose scoped clean verification.
- Export `estimate_proportional_tokens` for consumers that need the engine's
  bounded initial-context token estimate.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Session inputs now carry an explicit `SourceFormat`, with bounded bundle
  inputs and dedicated readers for supported Cline, Copilot CLI, and Kiro
  sources. Discovery metadata also exposes each source's format and surface.
- Claude and Codex readers expose bounded quota and provider-incident evidence.
  Aggregate reports separate user allocation limits from capacity, server, and
  connection failures, with affected sessions, models, and observation times.
- Remediation APIs now estimate and aggregate savings across all Burn Check
  detectors, provide safe fallback prompts for supported fixes, and expose
  stable detector keys and verification support.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `SessionInput` requires `source_format`, and
  `SessionReader::capabilities` now receives the full `SessionInput` instead of
  only `RawSource`. Readers reject a discovered format that does not match the
  selected parser rather than inferring a parser from paths or content.
- **Breaking:** evidence, report, turn, and remediation structures include new
  source-format, provider-incident, pricing-revision, one-hour cache-write, and
  per-detector attribution fields. `TargetAssessment::complete` is replaced by
  its typed `assessment` field.
- Advance parser revision to 39, analyzer revision to 24, evidence schema
  revision to 20, and coverage schema revision to 6. Resume snapshot revision
  remains 11 because resumable reader and sink state did not change.

### Fixed

- `Usage` gains `cache_creation_1h_tokens`, the subset of cache-creation
  tokens billed at Anthropic's one-hour rate. A Claude record's nested
  `cache_creation` breakdown (`ephemeral_1h_input_tokens`,
  `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens`) reports the exact split when present;
  otherwise Claude Code's cache-creation total counts as one-hour writes,
  since it has run with one-hour caching configured throughout. The
  efficiency reducer and turn rows now price that subset at 2x the input
  rate instead of the default cache-write rate. `TokenBurnTurnEvidence`'s
  report-time token estimates price the same subset at the same rate.
- Codex usage variants no longer double count matching records, and
  `spawn_agent` calls count as sub-agent launches.
- Pi usage samples use request-start timestamps while retaining response event
  metadata, and cache-rehydration and repeated-context accounting now use the
  correct request boundaries and denominators.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Raise the retained thread identity cap from 512 to 16,384 for long sessions.
  Overflow still marks attribution partial and blocks affected clean results.
- Advance analyzer revision to 22 so prior evidence is reprocessed with the
  larger identity cap.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Typed per-detector finding causes now support exact target grouping and
  deterministic remediation prompts bounded to 8 KiB, eight identities, and
  256 bytes per display identity.
- Old-model remediation APIs verify actual replacement use and recurrence on an
  exact provider, API, model, replacement, and scope. They calculate cumulative
  API-equivalent savings from pinned token-class rates and report unknown when
  evidence, rates, or a pricing revision is unavailable.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Session readers replace `VendorAdapter`, `ClaudeAdapter`,
  `PiAdapter`, `adapter_for`, and `has_dedicated_adapter` with `SessionReader`,
  `ClaudeSessionReader`, `PiSessionReader`, `reader_for`, and
  `has_dedicated_reader`. Compatibility aliases are not provided.
- Session readers expose source-format capabilities and preserve request-level
  provider, model, effort, and speed evidence.
- Partial Cursor and Antigravity source contracts preserve direct findings but
  cannot prove clean results. Unsupported parser wrappers no longer advertise
  usable session analysis.
- Old-model finding causes keep provider and API routes separate and include the
  reviewed replacement in their stable identity.
- Thread resume evidence retains at most 512 UUIDs of at most 256 bytes each.
  Overflow marks attribution partial, and oversized serialized resume state is
  rejected.

### Fixed

- Preserve delegated model controls when merging parent and child evidence.
- Require native OpenCode task proof instead of session ancestry for delegation.
- Distinguish available skill listings from injected skill documents.
- Invalidate earlier resume snapshots after changing resumable evidence state.
- Select cache-churn policy from `RepeatedContextAccounting`: `CacheWrite` uses
  Claude policy and `UncachedInput` uses OpenAI policy, including mixed-family
  sessions. Causes now select a model from the matching family.
- Keep token-burn estimates unknown when prices or the denominator are missing.
  Do not add a percentage fallback or force a positive minimum.
- Fingerprint all bytes of bounded inline content. OpenCode SQLite fingerprints
  stream all selected values across the accepted session, message, and part
  cluster, so content-only row changes invalidate prior work.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- API support notes now identify the batch-analysis, repository-orchestration,
  and serialized-metrics interfaces retained for external embeddings.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Aggregate Insights reports now expose finding, clean, unavailable, and
  not-applicable counts, plus bounded per-check and combined token-burn
  estimates. `SessionTokenBurnEvidence`, `TokenBurnTurnAccumulator`, and the
  related source and turn evidence types let an embedding supply the local
  inputs without transcript content.
- Context-source evidence can include built-in tool definitions, their token
  cost, invocation state, and deferred state. The unused built-in-tools check
  now produces findings for supported Claude sessions.
- `ContextWindowSource` records whether a context limit was reported, tagged,
  catalogued, or inferred. Pricing breakdown queries expose token use by the
  effective model and speed tier.
- `AgentExplorer::indexed_title_watch_files` and
  `Explorers::indexed_title_watch_files_for` expose vendor title stores to
  filesystem watchers.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `SessionInput` includes `fork_parent_session_id`, and session
  summaries and metrics include `context_window_source`. Report and evidence
  structures include the new aggregate, tool-definition, and pricing fields.
- Claude resume-as-fork sessions can link to their parent and exclude inherited
  records from the child's analysis. Replayed records with an earlier UUID are
  also excluded from work, usage, and evidence.
- Codex `token_usage` records contribute usage without double counting the
  matching event record. Agent tool calls count as sub-agent launches, and
  zero-usage synthetic turns no longer receive attributed work.
- Token-burn estimates use local session evidence for context overdepth,
  repeated context, model policy, speed, and unused context sources. The
  combined result avoids adding checks that can describe the same work.
- Model pricing distinguishes speed tiers, including GPT-6 Astra Fast.

### Fixed

- Claude context remains available for unknown model identifiers through an
  inferred 200k tier that expands to the observed peak. Tagged one-million-token
  models and Opus 5 use their correct context limits.
- Claude housekeeping and in-file resume records no longer make evidence
  incomplete or inflate usage. Thread links use `parentUuid` rather than an
  unrelated UUID field.
- Copilot CLI discovery accepts only `events.jsonl`, so unrelated JSONL files
  are not treated as sessions.
- A Claude skill keeps a known `SourceOrigin` after the session invokes it.
  Origin evidence that cannot be classified no longer suppresses the
  filesystem probe, and user skills still resolve when a worktree is removed.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Snapshot resume: `AdapterResume`, `AdapterSnapshot`, `EvidenceSnapshot`,
  `StreamSnapshot`, `RESUME_SNAPSHOT_REVISION`, and the
  `VendorAdapter::visit_claimed_resumed` seam. The Claude, Codex, and Pi
  adapters resume from a snapshot; a verified tail hash (`ResumePoint`,
  `RESUME_TAIL_BYTES`) guards the offset. The `resume_parity` test proves an
  incremental read equals one full pass over every adapter's fixtures.
- `source_resume` persistence in the row pipeline: `SOURCE_RESUME_SCHEMA_SQL`,
  `StoredResume`, `ResumeRevisions`, and the insert, query, restamp, and
  per-source delete helpers a fenced publish uses.
- `WatchRoot`, `AgentExplorer::watch_roots`, and `Explorers::watch_roots_for`
  expose the directories each agent's discovery reads, for a filesystem
  watcher.

### Changed

- Material cache rebuilds after a user resumes are cache rehydrations after 60
  minutes for Claude and 30 minutes for Codex. Other rebuilds are provider
  cache misses. Zero-only cache-write fields use loss-and-recovery inference.
- **Breaking:** `Explorers::discover_recent_sessions` is removed; callers use
  `discover_recent_sessions_with_progress`.
- The evidence fold keeps one accumulator per input and rebuilds the folded
  coverage record at the end of each pass, so a per-source residual can be
  snapshotted on its own.
- Discovery prunes before it stats: Codex walks only the date directories
  inside the recency window, Claude's sub-agent sweep skips a session whose
  parent is not recent and whose `subagents` directory is old, and
  Antigravity checks a database's mtime before opening it. Cursor's
  `agent-transcripts` and `chats` walks are now bounded by depth to the
  documented layout, rather than mtime-gated, so a rediscovery no longer
  reads a project's other subdirectories.

### Removed

- The whole-file session time-range readers: `scanner::session_time_range`
  and `scanner::session_time_range_str`. Nothing used them outside their own
  tests.
- The batched title-and-surface scan path: `AgentExplorer::session_title`,
  `AgentExplorer::session_titles_and_surfaces`, `SessionTitleAndSurface`,
  `Explorers::session_title_for`, and `Explorers::session_titles_and_surfaces_for`.
  Title lookups now go through `AgentExplorer::indexed_session_title` /
  `indexed_session_titles` (`Explorers::indexed_session_titles_for`), which
  read a durable per-agent index instead of scanning transcript content.
- The merged session-and-scan repository-discovery pipeline:
  `repositories::discover_repositories`, `DiscoveryRequest`,
  `SessionCwdSource`, `ExplorerCwdSource`, `AgentProgress`,
  `default_concurrency`, and `Explorers::discover_cwd_counts_with_progress`.
  Assembling repositories from session working directories is now the
  embedding application's job; `repositories::resolve_granted_repos` and
  `repositories::scan_roots_for_repos` remain as building blocks for it.
- The fast CWD-only discovery path: `Explorers::discover_cwds_with_progress`,
  `discovery::session_log_metadata`, and
  `discovery::agents::opencode::discover_cwds_in_wsl`. Nothing called them
  once the merged repository-discovery pipeline above was removed.
- `AgentExplorer::discover_cwds` and its default implementation. Nothing
  called the trait method once the fast CWD-only discovery path above was
  removed; each vendor's own optimized override went with it.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- `AntigravityAdapter` and `AntigravityExplorer` stream native Antigravity IDE
  and `agy` session sources with bounded token, model, cache, retry, timing, and
  tool evidence.
- `SessionCoverageRecord`, `EvidenceAccumulator::coverage_record`, and
  `evidence_from_facts` expose a serializable coverage snapshot and row-backed
  evidence replay contract.
- Analysis results expose bounded provider and model hints for downstream
  account attribution.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `install_runtime_pricing` now returns whether the active catalog
  changed, and the engine no longer supplies a built-in production pricing
  catalog. Consumers install a validated runtime catalog before calculating
  costs.
- **Breaking:** analysis result and row-sink contracts include coverage and
  provider-hint data used by persisted evidence replay.
- Antigravity discovery reads native SQLite and optional brain transcripts,
  detects source changes, and rejects mixed snapshots instead of publishing
  inconsistent analysis.
- Pi, OpenCode, and Antigravity records now retain bounded provider hints for
  provider-account grouping.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- The row pipeline exposes `TurnRow`, `TurnRowSink`, `TurnRowStore`, turn and
  content schema migrations, bounded batch writes, deletion helpers, and
  row-derived metrics and evidence queries.
- `TurnContent`, `ContentPart`, and `ContentKind` carry bounded message text,
  thinking, tool inputs, and tool results to a separate content table.
- `TurnFacts`, `metrics_from_rows`, and `metrics_by_source` rebuild projections
  from a fenced persisted snapshot.
- `ModelRegistry` and its policy contracts expose model-family, replacement,
  effort, and speed rules used by Insights.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `NormalizedRecord` gains `TurnContent`; `NormalizedEvent` gains
  logical parent and thread identity; and the report requirement contract now
  uses `Fact` and `FactState` instead of capability and evidence groups.
- Vendor adapters now derive stable thread relationships for Claude, Codex,
  OpenCode, and Pi, including delegated and sidechain turns. Codex also reads
  service tiers and cache-write tokens.
- Metrics and evidence reducers retain bounded derived state, account for
  repeated context per thread, and expose row-backed chart and drilldown data.
- Insights evaluates explicit finding and clean fact sets, preserves the last
  published verdict during recomputation, and declines clean results when a
  required fact is incomplete.
- macOS repository discovery treats `~/Developer` as a common unprotected code
  directory.

## [0.3.0-rc.1] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- The row pipeline exposes `TurnRow`, `TurnRowSink`, `TurnRowStore`, turn and
  content schema migrations, bounded batch writes, deletion helpers, and
  row-derived metrics and evidence queries.
- `TurnContent`, `ContentPart`, and `ContentKind` carry bounded message text,
  thinking, tool inputs, and tool results to a separate content table.
- `TurnFacts`, `metrics_from_rows`, and `metrics_by_source` rebuild projections
  from a fenced persisted snapshot.
- `ModelRegistry` and its policy contracts expose model-family, replacement,
  effort, and speed rules used by Insights.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `NormalizedRecord` gains `TurnContent`; `NormalizedEvent` gains
  logical parent and thread identity; and the report requirement contract now
  uses `Fact` and `FactState` instead of capability and evidence groups.
- Vendor adapters now derive stable thread relationships for Claude, Codex,
  OpenCode, and Pi, including delegated and sidechain turns. Codex also reads
  service tiers and cache-write tokens.
- Metrics and evidence reducers retain bounded derived state, account for
  repeated context per thread, and expose row-backed chart and drilldown data.
- Insights evaluates explicit finding and clean fact sets, preserves the last
  published verdict during recomputation, and declines clean results when a
  required fact is incomplete.
- macOS repository discovery now includes `~/Developer`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- `analysis::OpenCodeAdapter` and `SourceCapabilities::opencode()` provide
  bounded metrics and evidence from OpenCode JSONL exports and SQLite sessions.
  Claimed SQLite reads validate the session fingerprint inside one read snapshot.
- `insights::UnrecognizedRecords` and `insights::MAX_REPORT_UNRECOGNIZED_TYPES` expose a bounded discriminator set and non-exclusive cohort counts for inert, evidence-bearing, set-capped, and string-truncated unknown records.
- `analysis::PiAdapter` and `SourceCapabilities::pi()` provide bounded,
  source-validated metrics and evidence for Pi JSONL sessions.
- `NormalizedEvent::may_resolve_late_tool` identifies events whose tool call is
  available only in the final session summary. The hidden public field
  `NormalizedEvent::late_tool_candidate_is_builtin` identifies provisional
  built-in command candidates for bounded late-tool resolution.

### Changed

- `adapter_for("opencode")` now streams OpenCode SQLite sessions directly and
  no longer depends on a schema-agnostic SQLite fallback.
- Codex fork ownership lookahead keeps at most 256 records or 1 MiB. A later
  ownership marker reports partial attribution instead of retaining more rows.
- **Breaking:** `EvidenceObservation::UnrecognizedType` gains an `inert` field, `ParseDiagnostics` gains `records_unrecognized_inert`, and `EfficiencyReport` gains `unrecognized_records`. Its `UnrecognizedRecords` summary separates set-capped and string-truncated session counts. `PARSER_REVISION` is now 4 and `EVIDENCE_SCHEMA_REVISION` is now 3, so older stored evidence is stale and reprocessed lazily.
- Structurally inert unknown Claude records retain complete coverage and can produce report and badge results. Evidence-bearing unknowns still fail closed, including allowlisted eventless names that begin carrying shallow evidence. Known eventless records tolerate command echoes and unread scalar evidence-key names in nested configuration. Unknown discriminator truncation or collection overflow still produces `CapExceeded` and blocks clean results.
- `adapter_for("pi")` now selects the dedicated Pi adapter instead of the
  generic JSONL fallback.
- `SessionMetricsAccumulator` now retains bounded derived state instead of one
  entry per metric event. Large sessions merge facts on an active-position
  quantum, so continuous values can move between progress buckets. Additive
  totals remain exact outside documented collection caps.
- `merge_metrics` uses one shared active-time axis, adds efficiency per thread,
  honors parent source tags, and projects retained cache facts on the shared axis.
- `skill_uses` is capped at 256 entries, `tool_calls_by_name` at 256,
  `mcp_tool_calls` at 128, and model breakdowns and runs at 32. The export format
  remains version 2 because no field shape changed. Efficiency keeps 1,440
  ordered cost contributions. Beyond that cap, priced contributions can change
  floating-point accumulation order. The aggregate fallback fresh-token split
  remains per-turn exact. Efficiency also keeps 64 open
  fragmented messages and a 32-turn timestamp reorder window.
- `retained_turns()` is replaced by `observed_turns()`, and `retained_bytes()`
  reports reducer-owned derived state. `RETAINED_METRICS_BYTES_BOUND` publishes
  a 640 KiB derived-state contract. Exact caller-provided identity strings are
  additional.
- Summary models, skill descriptions, and initial-context details now use
  explicit bounds inside the metrics accumulator. Initial context keeps the 61
  largest named rows and up to three named source-total rows. Descriptions for
  invoked skills keep 300 characters and end with an ellipsis when shortened.
  Session identity strings remain exact.
- Tool, MCP, model, thinking-mode, speed, last-tool, and skill names use
  separate bounded stores. The limits are 256 tools, 128 MCP servers, 32
  normalized models, 32 bucket-display models, 64 thinking modes, 64 speeds,
  256 last-tool names, and 64 distinct skill names. Skill names keep 192 bytes;
  other names keep 64 bytes. Every shortened name uses a hash suffix.
- More than 1,024 active-time intervals merge a new interval with its nearer
  neighbour. This makes active duration and positions approximate inside the
  compacted span.
- `PARSER_REVISION` is 4 because unknown-record structural inertness changes
  parser behavior. `ANALYZER_REVISION` is 6, so cached analyses recompute once.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-27

This release starts the public engine release line under the MIT License. It has
the same API and behavior as `0.1.8`. Git consumers must update their pinned
commit SHA.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- `analysis::SessionEvidence`, `SessionEvidenceAccumulator`, and
  `CompositeSink` collect bounded, versioned evidence about context depth,
  tools, loaded skills and MCP servers, models, delegation, cache behavior,
  compactions, source coverage, and parse diagnostics in the same streaming
  pass that produces session metrics.
- `insights::EfficiencyReportAccumulator` reduces ready session evidence into
  a bounded report with explicit cohort, coverage, capability-gap, and
  per-detector counts. The API includes the nine detector identifiers and the
  evidence requirements for each detector; it does not yet implement detector
  policy.
- `analysis::tool_catalog` resolves the built-in tools and definition-token
  costs for a recorded harness version and model. Initial-context rows now
  include built-in tools, use counts, deferred-tool state, and known skill
  origins.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `InitialContextTokenSource` now represents `Skill`, `Mcp`, and
  `BuiltinTool`; it no longer exposes agent-instruction, system-instruction, or
  unattributed variants. `InitialContextBreakdown` no longer has
  `tracking_status` or `total_tokens`, and each `InitialContextSourceCount` now
  includes `use_count`, `origin`, and `deferred`.
- **Breaking:** `SessionMetrics` no longer exposes the categorical `tool_mix`
  totals. `NormalizedRecord` no longer carries `grep_count`, and
  `SessionSummary` no longer carries `grep_total`. Callers can use the new
  per-tool evidence and `tool_calls_by_name` data instead.
- Claude metrics and evidence now share one record-by-record pass. The engine
  records cache-routing misses, per-tool calls, MCP calls, model and effort
  changes, delegation, compaction boundaries, and bounded context evidence
  without rereading the transcript.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `VendorAdapter::visit` returns `VisitOutcome` rather than `()`.
  The default implementation returns `VisitOutcome::Unvalidated`, so an adapter
  that does not check source validity only needs its signature updated. Callers
  that discarded the unit result must now handle the outcome, because a
  successful return no longer means the records describe a single coherent
  source.
- **rusqlite moves back to the 0.32 line** from 0.40. `libsqlite3-sys` sets
  `links = "sqlite3"`, so a dependency graph may contain exactly one version of
  it — a constraint on resolution, not on the build, which therefore binds even
  when the conflicting dependency's features are off. An embedder that also uses
  SQLx 0.8 needs `libsqlite3-sys ^0.30.1`, which only rusqlite 0.31 and 0.32
  satisfy; against 0.40 such a graph simply fails to resolve, and the failure
  lands downstream rather than here. The engine used no API newer than 0.32, so
  the newer line bought nothing. `.github/dependabot.yml` now ignores `rusqlite`
  and `libsqlite3-sys` so an automated bump cannot silently reintroduce this.
- Per-agent discovery completion now logs at `debug` rather than `info`. It
  reported once per agent per scan, which is scan bookkeeping rather than
  something an embedder's default log level should carry.

### Added

- `analysis::EfficiencyTotals` and `analysis::thread_efficiency` split the cost
  of priced assistant turns into new work, cached carry, and rewritten input.
  The calculation merges records for one message, orders turns by timestamp,
  and reports unpriced turns separately. Callers calculate each parent or
  sub-agent event stream on its own, then combine totals with
  `EfficiencyTotals::add`.
- `analysis::source_validity` decides whether a transcript that was read still
  describes the source it claimed to: `SourceClaim`, `PinnedSource`,
  `PinnedOpen`, `PinnedReader`, `AppendOnlyGuarantee`, and
  `append_only_guarantee`. `PinnedSource::open` pins a claimed source,
  `recheck_prefix` and `recheck_full` re-verify it after reading, and each
  returns the specific way it diverged rather than a bare failure.
- `analysis::VisitOutcome` and `analysis::SourceChangedReason` report that
  verdict to a caller. `AcceptedFull`, `AcceptedPrefix { boundary }`, and
  `Unvalidated` distinguish a fully verified read from a verified prefix and
  from no check at all, so a partial result is usable instead of merely
  suspect. `SourceChangedReason` names the divergence — identity mismatch, a
  short file at open, a head-region mismatch, a short read, truncation after
  reading, or a fingerprint mismatch.
- `ClaudeAdapter` is exported, and `ClaudeAdapter::visit_claimed` streams a
  Claude transcript against a `SourceClaim`, validating the read rather than
  trusting it.
- `discovery::SourceStat::from_open_std_file` stats an already-open
  `std::fs::File`, which is what the pinned-read path holds.

### Added

- `analysis::framing` frames a JSONL transcript one record at a time.
  `BoundedJsonlReader` and `FramedRecord` hold each record under
  `MAX_RECORD_BYTES`, so a single oversized or malformed line cannot make a scan
  allocate without bound, and the caller can cancel between records.
- `analysis::interface` adds a streaming seam for transcript records:
  `RecordSink`, `NormalizedRecord`, `RecordSkip`, `RecordCoverage`,
  `PartialReason`, `SessionSummary`, and `SessionCollector`. An adapter reports
  one record at a time and finishes with a `SessionSummary`. `SessionCollector`
  accumulates the same `NormalizedSession` the whole-document path produces and
  reports the coverage and the partial reasons for it.
- `discovery::source_version` gives a session source a storage-neutral identity
  and version: `SourceDescriptor`, `SourceVersion`, `SourceStat`,
  `FingerprintInputs`, `Streamability`, `head_hash_of`, and
  `FINGERPRINT_HEAD_BYTES`, with `SourceRead` in `discovery`.
  `Explorers::source_version` builds the value, and a scan keeps the
  fingerprint, so a caller can tell an unchanged source from a grown one without
  reading the transcript again.
- `analysis::merge::merge_subagent_events` folds a sub-agent transcript into its
  parent session, and `EventSource` records which transcript an event came from.
- `SessionMetrics` carries `model_runs: Vec<ModelRun>`, `compaction_count`, and
  `cache_rehydration_count`. A `Bucket` carries `cache_read_tokens`,
  `cache_write_tokens`, `is_cache_rehydration`, `subagent_tokens`,
  `secs_since_prior_turn`, `subagent_launches`, `user_prompts`, `last_tool`,
  `model`, `thinking_mode`, `speed`, `has_thinking`, `compaction_trigger`
  (`CompactionTrigger`), `compaction_pre_tokens`, and `compaction_post_tokens`.

### Changed

- Analysis and discovery now emit structured local diagnostic events at silent
  recovery seams. This change does not alter analysis results or public APIs.
- The bundled TOML integration now uses `toml` 1.1.4.

### Removed

- The session pattern analytics surface: `Phase`, `PhaseSegment`,
  `PhaseDistribution`, `MIN_PHASE_WEIGHT`, and `active_time_fraction`. What they
  reported did not describe the sessions they claimed to describe.
- The local skill detail surface: `SkillDetail`, `LocalSkillDetails`, and
  `SkillScope`.

### Fixed

- Codex title discovery now distinguishes user-set names and generated titles
  from raw first-message fallbacks in the current state database. Generated
  session-index names can replace raw prompts, while legacy title-only state
  databases keep their existing rename behavior.
- Codex cache rehydration is now inferred when the cached prefix stays cached,
  and the `token_count` row Codex repeats on resume no longer counts twice.
- A Codex compaction is now detected from a top-level compacted record.
- A session keeps its own context window in its summary rather than the
  reference window.
- A multi-model session now reports stable cost totals across repeated analysis.
- Codex task titles are restored.
- The spawn-edges sidecar is flushed before its rename.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- The bundled SQLite integration now uses `rusqlite` 0.40.2.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- `AgentExplorer::indexed_session_titles` and
  `Explorers::indexed_session_titles_for` batch title lookups from durable
  vendor indexes without falling through to transcript content. Shared indexes
  are opened once per batch, so background discovery can reuse its bounded
  transcript metadata on misses.

### Fixed

- Claude and Codex discovery now derives session recency from meaningful
  transcript events rather than filesystem modification times. Agent
  housekeeping such as title, mode, permission, and token-count updates no
  longer makes an idle session look active, while subagent transcript activity
  still advances its parent session. Incremental aggregate cursors keep this
  provider-aware scan bounded across unchanged parent and child transcripts.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- `repositories::partition_cwds_by_grants` lets an embedding application split
  working directories into immediately safe and consent-deferred paths without
  touching the filesystem. `repositories::verify_dir_access` exposes the same
  directory-read check discovery uses, including stale-grant revocation and
  probe diagnostics.

### Fixed

- Repository resolution no longer starts `git` inside an ungranted macOS
  protected directory. Working directories under Documents, Desktop, and
  Downloads are deferred before any filesystem or child-process access, so a
  background scan cannot raise the operating system's consent dialog.
- A grant revoked outside the application is removed when a directory read is
  denied, and its diagnostic probe now uses the same `denied` outcome vocabulary
  as an application-requested consent check.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- `pricing::normalize_model_key` no longer panics on model IDs containing
  multi-byte UTF-8 characters. Model IDs come from external transcript files;
  the date-suffix check now runs on bytes and only slices at a confirmed ASCII
  hyphen boundary.
- The scan-down arm of `repositories::resolve_granted_repos` reports the
  canonical repository path in `repo_root` and `suspected_path` instead of the
  folded identity key (which lowercases and slash-normalizes on Windows). The
  key now serves only deduplication, matching the session-resolved arm and the
  documented field contract.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Initial public surface of the local engine, extracted as a self-contained
  crate:
  - `discovery` — local discovery of AI coding-agent sessions from documented
    files, read-only databases, and bounded WSL paths.
  - `analysis` — transcript and session analysis.
  - `repositories` — repository identity.
  - `pricing` — API-equivalent pricing.
  - `model`, `paths`, `platform` — shared local data model, filesystem roots,
    and platform handling.
  - Versioned local persistence and export contracts.
- The crate's local boundary as a compatibility contract: no dependency on any
  service of ours, no private dependencies, and a public API that carries no
  authentication, organization, remote-sharing, enrichment, or telemetry
  concepts. Enforced mechanically by the crate's boundary test suite.
