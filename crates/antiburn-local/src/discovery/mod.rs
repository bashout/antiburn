//! Local discovery of AI coding-agent sessions.
//!
//! Discovery answers three questions about the machine it runs on: which agent
//! sessions exist, where each one ran, and what to call it. Everything here
//! reads documented on-disk layouts, read-only vendor databases, and bounded
//! WSL paths — discovery itself opens no socket, probes no running process,
//! and calls no vendor's local API. That is a property of this module, not a
//! rule antiburn holds everywhere: an embedding application that wants live
//! enrichment (inspecting a running agent, calling it over loopback) layers
//! that on top (see [`SessionMirror`]).
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! - [`AgentExplorer`] is the per-agent contract: recent sessions, path
//!   ownership, surface classification, titles, sub-agents.
//! - [`agents`] holds one adapter per supported agent.
//! - [`Explorers`] binds a set of adapters together and provides the
//!   fan-out and point-lookup entry points callers actually use.
//! - [`scanner`] turns a session's bytes into [`scanner::SessionMetadata`].
//! - [`fork`] carries locally observed session lineage.
//!
//! # Extending an adapter
//!
//! Adapters are `&'static` values, so an application can construct its own
//! configured copies (extra mirror directories, a duplicate-fork detector) and
//! hand [`Explorers::new`] a lookup that returns them. [`Explorers::DISK`] is
//! the unconfigured, disk-only default.

///    from any other agent's tree.
/// 3. **Cline** — `.cline/` plus extension-id substrings; specific enough
///    to win over any IDE-app-config match that happens to contain
///    `cline.cline`.
/// 4. **Kiro** — Kiro IDE-config-specific paths; no overlap.
/// 5. **Amp Code** — narrow `/amp/threads/` and `.amp/file-changes/`
///    fragments.
/// 6. **Pi** — narrow `/.pi/agent/` fragment; CLI-only.
/// 7. **Antigravity** — checked *before* Copilot/Cursor: its IDE chat tree
///    sits at `User/workspaceStorage/...` which a loosened Copilot/Cursor
///    matcher could otherwise claim.
/// 8. **Copilot** — checked *before* Cursor for the same reason: its
///    VS Code chatSessions path is more specific and must not be stolen by
///    a future relaxed Cursor substring match.
/// 9. **Windsurf** — `.codeium/windsurf/` and Windsurf-app-config paths;
///    specific.
/// 10. **Cursor** — broadest of the IDE-family matchers; placed late so
///     the narrower agents above win first.
/// 11. **Claude** — fallback default. `ClaudeExplorer::owns_path` returns
///     `false` by design, so iteration always falls through to the
///     `unwrap_or(Claude)` arm in [`Explorers::infer_agent_type`] — Claude owns
