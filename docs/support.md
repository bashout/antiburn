# antiburn v1 support

What this version of antiburn actually supports, and what it stores. Anything not
listed here is not claimed — a cell that is absent means "not supported", not
"probably works".

## Platforms

| Platform                                              | v1 support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Agents

antiburn reads session data that a coding agent has already written to disk.
Plan limits are separate: antiburn can ask a provider for those figures as
described in [Network](#network).

**Disk-only** means sessions come from the agent's own documented local files; the
live language-server APIs those two editors expose aren't read, so a session that
exists only in memory will not appear.

## Burn Check remediation

The main Burn checks workspace shows supported findings only for the agents and
checks listed below. The first-tier grouping is product documentation only; it
does not change parsing, findings, prompts, Auto Fix, or verification. Those
behaviors depend on the evidence and capabilities of each agent. `Finding-only`
means it cannot report a clean result. Check codes are defined in
[Burn Check Source Coverage](check-coverage.md#checks). The Auto Fix column below
lists every reachable operation by check code; the
[automatic editor matrix](check-coverage.md#automatic-editor-support) gives the
exact binding limits. The same document has the exhaustive prompt matrix.

Each Auto Fix changes one winning control after a separate review and
confirmation. It changes a global or user control when projects inherit it, and
changes a project control only for that exact explicit project setting or
resource. It does not batch scalar controls or create project config files.
Findings across projects share one action when they resolve to the same global
control, and every project context is checked again before the write. The only
approved missing-global creation is Claude Code settings for an eligible
optional built-in tool. Claude project scope requires the exact bare tool name
in `permissions.allow`. Model and reasoning edits remain pinned to their saved
attribution, and Claude fast mode writes `false`. A controller-reported runtime
or managed override can prevent an immediate behavior change; the review shows
this warning. Check-level Copy can provide bounded generic text only when it can
select at least one current target. Every returned prompt has a durable attempt
reference. Native Windows can read supported setting attribution but
cannot apply a change. Pi and Oh My Pi session discovery remains unavailable on
native Windows. WSL is separate and cannot edit native host config. See the
[implementation guide](remediation.md) for precedence, verification, savings,
privacy, and exact unavailable cases.

**Session analysis** — the timeline, activity segments, context, token, and cost views — need a
transcript format antiburn understands in detail. Where it has only a generic parse,
the session is still listed and the analysis view says so rather than showing an
empty chart that looks like an idle session.

## Cost estimates

Costs are computed on this device from the latest valid models.dev snapshot, against
the tokens a transcript recorded. They are **API-equivalent estimates**, not a bill:

- prices refresh at startup and hourly while the app runs; the snapshot date is
  shown in Settings → About;
- a model with no price in the catalog produces no figure rather than a wrong zero,
  and the provider's total is then labelled as a floor;
- work done on another machine is not counted, because antiburn cannot see it.

Provider Usage shows what was _spent_ on this machine. It never shows a percentage,
an allowance, a remaining balance, or a reset time: a transcript records spend, and a
denominator would have to be invented.

**Plan limits are a separate thing, from a separate place.** antiburn asks each
provider directly and shows the figures that provider stated — a percentage of a
five-hour or weekly allowance, and when it resets. Those are the provider's numbers,
not ours:

- when the popover opens, antiburn shows its last successful reading immediately
  and asks for a current reading in the background;
- the current response replaces the saved reading. If antiburn has no saved reading,
  the limits section stays absent until the first response arrives;
- every reading shows when antiburn received it. A reading older than an hour is
  marked as stale rather than ageing quietly on screen;
- a figure the provider did not state is shown as unknown, never as zero;
- the limits appear above the spend estimates and never replace them. See
  [Network](#network) for the connections and the switch that controls them.

Session cards can also show an estimated cumulative share of a provider allowance
across recorded five-hour or weekly periods. antiburn distributes each provider
percentage over matching local session work, so this is an estimate and can exceed
100%. A partial coverage label means the estimate can omit usage or use incomplete
account or provider-history evidence. This session estimate remains after a provider
reset. The provider meter still shows only the current allowance period.

For Codex, antiburn can also read the rate-limit metadata a session's own rollout
file already recorded, so a directly or singly attributed account has meter history
from before this app was installed, not only from readings taken while it ran. This
bounded, resumable local read looks only at each rollout file's `token_count` rate-
limit events; it does not read or retain transcript message content. A rollout
reading older than the local data retention setting is never imported. An account
that resolves to more than one Codex login on this machine is skipped, the same as
for a live reading.

## What antiburn stores

antiburn keeps its own local data under the application's data directory. Settings →
About shows the exact path. It may retain the session content and derived data it
needs to provide visibility and analysis, including messages, tool activity, file
content recorded in a transcript, session identity and locations, counts, durations,
token totals, activity distributions, cost estimates, skill details, derived session
evidence — bounded facts about which models, tools, skills, and MCP servers a
session used, and any limits it recorded hitting, never the transcript's
text — session relations, the last successful plan-limit reading, and timestamped
provider usage readings for an opaque account key. Provider usage readings follow
the selected session-data retention period, the same as other local data; a
forever setting keeps them indefinitely. Clearing local data removes them.
antiburn retains compact per-session allowance estimates while their sessions
remain, even after the raw provider readings expire. This data stays on the
device and is never uploaded.

The coding agents' source transcripts remain their files. antiburn may copy data from
them into its own local store, but it never modifies or deletes the source files.

**Session retention is configurable.** Settings → Privacy can keep antiburn's local
session data for 30 days, 90 days, or forever. Forever is the default and can preserve
history after providers' 30-day retention window. A shorter period keeps the local
index lighter. Deleting a transcript from disk does not immediately delete what
antiburn derived from it; that data follows the selected retention period unless the
session or local index is deleted first. The agents' own files are never touched.

**Deletion.** antiburn removes only records it created itself. It cannot and will not
delete a coding agent's own transcript — that is the agent's file, and removing a
conversation belongs in the agent's own interface.

**Folder permissions (macOS).** macOS guards Documents, Desktop, and Downloads behind
your explicit consent. antiburn never reads one of them until you have allowed it: a
repository recorded in a guarded folder is skipped, and antiburn tells you it was
skipped rather than asking the system for access on its own. The permission dialog you
see is one antiburn asked for because you pressed a button, and what it wants is
narrow — the git repositories your coding agents worked in, read for their names and
locations. If you decline, the folder is simply left alone; you can change your mind
in Settings → Sources, or revoke access in System Settings, and antiburn will notice
the next time it looks.

## Network

antiburn needs no account or backend for its main work. The connections it makes
beyond analytics and updates are yours, not ours: reading
a provider's own figures with your own credentials is traffic between this machine
and a provider you already use. antiburn also downloads a public model-price catalog
from models.dev at startup and hourly while it runs. That request sends no session
data or credentials, and the last valid copy stays on this machine. The application's
own connection to a service of
ours are analytics and the updater. The updater asks GitHub Releases whether a newer
version exists. When automatic updates are enabled, it downloads and installs the
signed bundle and restarts antiburn. The app never depends on either connection.

- The check sends nothing about you, your machine, or your sessions.
- It runs on a schedule only while "Install updates automatically" is on, and can
  always be run by hand from Settings → About.
- An automatic update downloads, verifies, and installs the new version. antiburn
  restarts as soon as installation succeeds.
- An install verifies the downloaded bundle against the public key in the app before
  it changes the installed application.
- Development builds carry no updater at all.
- Linux AppImage releases update in the app. Debian packages remain install-only
  and require the next package to be installed manually.
- **Anonymised product analytics** are the one thing antiburn reports to us.
  Official release builds start with it on, including during onboarding. The Ready
  screen explains it, and the switch is in Settings → Privacy. The event schema has thirty-one fields and
  no others: the constant `desktop`; a random per-message id used to discard
  duplicate deliveries; a random installation identifier replaced every 30 days;
  a random analytics-session identifier; the event name; the time it happened and the time it was delivered; the
  processor architecture; a count rounded into a range where the event has one;
  a short label naming a surface, Settings pane, provider, setting, agent
  category, or failure category, never work content or an entered value; a
  second fixed label where needed; whether a visible state followed a user or
  automatic exposure, or whether a Burn Check watch started passively or from
  an action; a coarse five-hour usage
  band; the reset response shape; eligibility, experiment membership, experiment
  arm, and availability states; an allowlisted ineligibility reason; a reset-count
  bucket; whether a next-reset date was present; a learned session-limit
  factor's plan mapped to a fixed list; that factor's dollars-per-percent value
  reduced to a coarse band; how far that factor's estimate and the provider's
  own meter disagree, also reduced to a coarse band; for one finished usage
  window, whether a dollars-only estimate landed above or below the meter and
  by how much, how much of the meter's rise no local session could explain,
  and whether a reading covered the window's end, each reduced to a coarse
  band; a nested hourly summary of
  fixed bands and coverage for antiburn's own shell CPU, memory, process I/O,
  database size, and database-log size; up to 16 sanitized unknown transcript
  record type names, each checked against a fixed character set and length,
  with a rejected name replaced by a fixed placeholder instead of being sent;
  the app version; and the operating system. The payload has no
  field able to carry anything else. The analytics-session identifier changes
  after 30 minutes without a captured analytics event, when the app restarts,
  or when the installation identifier rotates.
  Its generator is memory-only, but each queued event stores the value on disk
  until that event is sent or removed. Background events can keep it active, so
  it does not measure a user visit or time spent. Because each event is
  timestamped and the installation identifier lasts up to 30 days, the events
  do show roughly when events were captured within that window; they do not show
  the content or identity of what the app was used on. Resource ranges can
  reveal coarse app work intensity and local data volume.
  [analytics.md](analytics.md) is the complete account: every field,
  the full event catalog, and how to verify all of it yourself.
  Never sent: session content, transcripts, prompts, titles, file paths, repository or
  branch names, token counts, costs, or credentials. Switching it off deletes
  the identifier and anything still queued. The endpoint also stores the request
  IP address and user-agent. Raw events are retained until the operator deletes
  them. Default source and development builds exclude the analytics client.
- There is **no third-party analytics, telemetry, or crash-reporting SDK** in this
  application. The channel above is first-party and is the only one.

**One setting makes antiburn go online as you.** Settings → Usage has a switch,
on by default once first-run setup is complete, that lets antiburn ask each
provider directly for your current plan usage every five minutes in the
background, and more often while a usage surface is visible. It uses the
credential your coding tool already keeps on this machine (for example, the
Claude CLI's own OAuth credential, or the Codex CLI's own). It runs by default
because this is your own traffic: your usage, from a provider you already use,
with a credential you already hold, over your own connection — no antiburn
server sees the request or the response. Where your coding tool has already
saved the same figures on this machine, antiburn reads that copy first and
skips the request when the copy is recent enough: Claude Code keeps the last
reading it fetched in its own config file, and the Codex CLI records the
account's limits in each session log. When a provider's endpoint cannot be
reached directly, antiburn falls back to asking your coding tool's own local
process the same question, over its own protocol, or to the reading the tool
saved most recently, rather than leaving the reading blank. Turn the switch off
if you want none of this — no background traffic at all, whatever the reason —
and antiburn stops asking, reads no credential or saved reading, and has no
plan limits to show.

**Notifications are local.** antiburn shows them in its own small notification
window and posts exactly these: an update check that found a newer version, the
first scan failure of a run, free disk space dropping below your threshold, a
usage milestone, the first-run menu-bar location, and the test button's own
sample. Milestones need readings that keep moving, so they fire only while
Settings → Usage is set to refresh; with that off they stay silent. By default,
they fire at every 10% of a limit and compare limit used with time elapsed in
that limit's window. Settings → Notifications offers every 5% step, plus
select-all and clear-all controls. Every successful live reading checks for a
crossing, and the hidden background monitor checks at most every five minutes.
When usage jumps between readings, the notification names both the crossed
milestone and the provider's current percentage. antiburn constructs each
notification on this machine, and nothing about it leaves the machine. The test
and first-run location ignore the master switch because both follow a direct
action.

**Notifications respect Focus and Do Not Disturb.** Immediately before an
automated notification appears, antiburn asks your operating system whether
interruptions are welcome — Focus and Do Not Disturb on macOS, fullscreen and
presentation states on Windows, Do Not Disturb on GNOME and KDE Plasma. A
suppressed notification is dropped, not saved: turning Focus off never releases
a backlog of stale alerts. The test button still works during Focus, because
you pressed it. On macOS this needs your permission once — antiburn asks after
setup, reads only whether Focus is on, and nothing about it leaves this Mac; if
you decline, notifications simply stop yielding to Focus. If antiburn is in a
Focus's Allowed Apps list, macOS lets its notifications through, and antiburn
follows that answer. When the system cannot say either way, antiburn delivers
rather than staying silent.

## Reporting a gap

If an agent on this list is not discovered on a supported platform, that is a bug —
please open an issue with the agent, its version, your platform, and where its
session files live. Not sure it is a bug? Ask in the
