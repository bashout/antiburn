# Burn Check Source Coverage

Audit date: 2026-09-23.

This document covers local passive session evidence and the desktop's read-only
current resource inventory. Session evidence supports historical claims. Current
inventory supports claims about what is enabled now. It cannot prove what a past
session exposed. Existing persisted output from the reviewed Pi example extension
is a passive input. The current OpenCode WSL discovery conflict is recorded in
`session-coverage.md`.

See [`session-coverage.md`](session-coverage.md) for discovery, framing, parsing,
companion-source, and provider-route coverage for the same source formats.

## Status Rules

| Status      | Meaning                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assessable  | The current reader can produce the evidence needed for a finding and a clean result. A damaged or incomplete session can still be partial.        |
| Partial     | The source has useful evidence, but its supported claims are limited. It cannot support a clean result.                                           |
| Unsupported | The reviewed passive sources do not prove a required fact or its policy semantics. This is source-scoped, not a claim about future formats.       |
| Unknown     | The source or its relevant field semantics are not characterized. Do not infer support from a path, field name, mode name, or generic JSON shape. |

`Partial` can support a scoped finding only when its source note says so. It does
not promise an implemented finding path. An unimplemented or uncharacterized
path is `Unknown` or `Unsupported`.
`Assessable` describes an accepted source contract, not every session or past
release. A clean result still needs complete session facts and eligible activity.

## Checks

| Code | Check                 |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| D    | Session overdepth     |
| T    | Model overthinking    |
| S    | Overpowered subagents |
| M    | Unused MCP servers    |
| B    | Unused built-in tools |
| K    | Unused skills         |
| O    | Old model usage       |
| F    | Fast mode overuse     |
| C    | Cache churn           |

## Source Inventory

The tables list all 33 `SourceFormat` keys. Known source shape and release
version are separate facts. A version range is not always available; an accepted
schema, header, or pinned producer commit with synthetic fixtures can establish
a bounded contract. No row promises parity across all historical versions.

| `SourceFormat`                 | Passive source format                                                     | Version statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Current reader                        |

## Coverage Matrix

This manual matrix records implemented eligibility and audited source limits,
not just binary capability flags. The inventory test checks keys and cell
vocabulary; behavior tests separately check finding and clean gates.

## First-Tier Product Matrix

Support means reachable product behavior, not a parser flag or an unused engine
function. This documentation-only grouping does not gate runtime behavior.
`Finding` is `Y`, `FO` (a finding without a clean-result claim), or `N`.
`Prompt`, `Verification`, and `Estimate` are `Y` or `N`. `Auto Fix` is `Y`, `C`
(only with an exact production binding), `P` (prompt only), or `N`. Prompt `Y`
requires both an engine recommendation and a finding that the desktop can
reach. Estimate `Y` means the finding can reach its typed estimate or bounded
finding-rate fallback; it does not promise a numeric measured value.

The engine contract checks source findings, recommendation support, and estimate
methods. The desktop contract also requires a reachable watch before it accepts
verification, a reachable inventory target before it accepts an M/B/K prompt,
and production editor policy plus a typed target operation before it accepts
Auto Fix. The limit stays beside the row it qualifies.

Cursor and Antigravity M/K are current-inventory targets, not historical
exposure claims. Pi S remains limited to reviewed example-extension evidence.
M/B/K estimates can use measured replicated tokens when available and otherwise
the bounded finding-rate fallback. The fallback is not measured token or price
evidence.

## Second-Tier Product Coverage

GitHub Copilot, Cline, Kiro, Amp, Devin, Oh My Pi, and Mistral Vibe remain
second-tier in product documentation. This defers no implemented parser, finding path, prompt,
Auto Fix, verification, or burn-estimate behavior. The accepted Copilot CLI v1
event and schema-v7 request-store bundle supports S/O results. It does not
support D because the production reader has no request-depth evidence. Oh My Pi
supports D/T/O results from the shared Pi core. Overdepth reads the largest
single request, so an in-file abandoned branch cannot change the context of
another request. It does not support S, because OMP subagents live in sibling
files this reader does not open. It has no inventory, no remediation prompt,
and no clean result. Mistral Vibe supports T/O findings from the unified
session store. The model alias is written only when a session pins one, so
a model finding needs that alias and stays out of reach otherwise. It does
not support D or C, because the store records a cumulative session token
total rather than per-request usage, so there is no request-depth or
cache-episode evidence. It does not support S, because the `child-*`
subagent stores this harness writes are not opened. It has no inventory, no
remediation prompt, and no clean result. The other current
source and check limits remain the source inventory and coverage matrix
above.

## Evidence Boundaries

Remote session copies retain the accepted Claude Code or Codex transcript
contract; they do not acquire broader coverage by arriving over SSH. A
per-session finding requires sufficient accepted copied evidence. Missing
companions and historical configuration remain unavailable or partial, never
clean. This computer's configuration and provider account do not enrich remote
evidence. Bounded discovery does not establish a complete remote inventory.
Rejected or incomplete exports keep the previous cached generation; a partial
host scan does not establish fresh evidence for the rejected sessions. Skipping
expired listing candidates does not prove a complete companion roster; Codex
exports still require bounded origin discovery for older linked children.
Remote sessions do not contribute to the local global-check report,
Overview, quota attribution, or live HUD. Local path actions, Auto Fix, and
remediation/watch enrollment reject remote origins at the backend boundary.
The product and remediation matrices below describe native supported contexts;
they do not grant remote editing or verification. See
[remote sessions](remote-sessions.md) for the supported host and agent limits.

Lifecycle provider sweeps use same-turn published provider/model evidence and
keep the harness and inferred model vendor separate from the recorded route.
Missing or custom routes do not prove direct provider activity. These display
signals do not authorize a finding, a clean result, remediation, or historical
spend attribution; all check-specific route and API requirements below remain
unchanged. See [`session-lifecycle-events.md`](session-lifecycle-events.md#scoped-sweep-evidence).

Burn checks use only sessions admitted by the repository scan gate. A session
needs a resolvable Git repository CWD. Disabled roots and their linked
worktrees are excluded before evidence processing; missing or unresolved CWDs
are unavailable, never clean.

No current session reader proves a full historical resource inventory. The
legacy per-session M/B/K rules deny `Clean`, even when a nested observed-resource
map is complete. The desktop target assessment can report clean only when every
applicable current inventory scan and positive-use input is complete and within
its bounds. A scoped finding requires complete coverage of that observed subset,
calls, and eligible activity. An unrelated partial resource group does not block it.
Detector-level absence never verifies an M/B/K remediation. Unavailable,
partial, wrong-source, wrong-agent, wrong-scope, truncated, and non-applicable
evidence does not verify the target.

The native desktop advisory inventory is separate from these per-session
detector rules. It enumerates bounded standard current resources for Claude
Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Cline, OpenCode, Kiro, Amp, Antigravity,
Devin/Windsurf, and Pi and can merge current indexed resource observations. Its result
contains logical names, state, scope, provenance, and
limits only. Skill candidates can include a proportional token estimate for the
frontmatter `title` or `name` plus `description`. The estimate excludes the
skill body. The inventory contains no physical path or selector.

The desktop 30-day report reduction now creates a separate target-based M/B/K
assessment. One key contains the exact agent, resource kind, normalized name,
and global or canonical repository scope. Any exact positive use in that scope
suppresses the key. Remaining candidates become one target each, not one target
per session. The assessment records target totals and at most three supporting
sessions per target. The shipped Checks DTO and action command use this
assessment for M/B/K category counts, agents, status, burn estimates, and named
target rows. They do not use the older session-based M/B/K rows.

Positive use can come from tool counts, invoked loaded sources,
catalog-backed tool definitions, or persisted initial-context source rows.
Observed positive facts remain valid inside partial evidence. Partial or
unsupported facts, malformed or dynamic applicable inventory, unknown scope,
ambiguous aliases, failed scans, and repository, context, use, directory, or
target caps block clean. They do not remove a known finding from an unrelated
kind, scope, or agent. Disabled current resources do not become candidates.

Global candidates share use only across the same agent. Project candidates
share use only inside one canonical accessible repository. A raw call with no
origin uses a same-name project candidate in its repository before a global
candidate. Unknown-origin indexed resources do not become scoped targets.
Same-name resources in separate scopes and repositories stay separate.

Resource burn estimates use the report's existing total-token denominator and
rounding. Skill listing tokens use the existing proportional `chars / 4`
estimate and replicate across applicable assistant turns. MCP estimates use
only measured indexed definition tokens. Claude Code and Codex built-in tools
reuse measured catalog definitions. Only optional specialized tools can become B
targets; required shell, read, write, edit, search, and subagent tools remain
measured but never become findings. OpenCode 1.2.15 and Pi 0.52.12 use pinned
default catalog captures. A matching positive use removes the target and its
estimate. A missing definition, missing denominator, cap, truncation, or
arithmetic failure uses the detector's bounded finding-rate fallback instead
of presenting no percentage. Measured token attribution always replaces that
fallback. The fallback is an estimated workload share, not measured tokens or
price data. It stays within the 0% to 100% display range.

B tool eligibility is a product safety policy, not a claim that vendors make
other tools impossible to disable. The only eligible names are Claude Code
`WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `Workflow`, `ReportFindings`, and `ScheduleWakeup`, Codex `web_search`, and OpenCode `websearch` and
`webfetch`. Pi, Cursor, Copilot, Cline, Kiro, Amp Code, Antigravity, and
Windsurf have no B target. Shell, read, write, edit, search, task, agent, and
subagent tools remain measured but never become B targets for any agent.
Every displayed resource target has at least one supporting failed session. A
resource without that session evidence makes the category unavailable instead
of creating a target without a session to open.

The reviewed primary sources are Claude Code [permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions)
and [tools](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools), Codex [configuration
reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-file/config-reference),
OpenCode [permissions](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/) and
[tools](https://opencode.ai/docs/tools/), Pi [settings](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md#tools),
and Cursor [SDK tool restrictions](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/python#restricting-the-toolset).
These sources show that several core tools are configurable. They do not
identify them as optional, so antiburn does not suggest disabling them.
Claude Code documents `Workflow` as a separate dynamic-workflow tool and
documents independent feature controls in its [workflows](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/workflows#turn-workflows-off)
and [settings reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings-reference#disableworkflows).

Provider matching accepts exact case-insensitive names and the reviewed call
forms: Claude Code and Codex `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, OpenCode
`<server>_<tool>`, and `pi-mcp-extension` 1.5.0 default
`mcp_<sanitized-server>_<tool>`. Claude Code and Codex accept a unique bare
suffix for namespaced skills and the final segment of a catalog-backed built-in
alias. Ambiguous skill aliases suppress every possible matching target and
block clean. OpenCode and Pi MCP names can be ambiguous because the server and tool share one underscore
delimiter. Such a call suppresses every possible matching server finding and
blocks clean, but it does not count any server as used. OpenCode and Pi use exact
skill and built-in names.

The accepted current shapes are Claude standard user/project `mcpServers`,
standard `.claude/skills`, `skillOverrides`, and exact permission controls;
Codex trusted layered `mcp_servers` with omitted `enabled` treated as enabled,
plus standard `.agents/skills` and compatibility `.codex/skills`; OpenCode
JSON/JSONC direct and `mcp.servers` maps, standard skill roots, Boolean `tools`,
and object or array permission controls; and Pi `defaultTools`, standard skill
roots, explicit non-pattern skill directories, and pinned
`pi-mcp-extension` 1.5.0. The Pi package manifest must name version 1.5.0 and
`./src/index.ts`; the reviewed producer commit is
`8a01fc53f3289d2e8eb492d67ba45cd84d64e7f2`. Runtime, managed, remote, plugin,
pattern, lazy Pi MCP, malformed, unsafe, capped, conflicting, and partial
indexed sources remain explicit clean-result limits.

Inventory files are Cursor `.cursor/mcp.json`; Copilot
`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, `.mcp.json`, and `.github/mcp.json`; Cline MCP
settings; Kiro `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`; Amp settings; Antigravity
`mcp_config.json`; and Devin/Windsurf MCP settings. Their documented skill roots
are scanned in global and project scope. Where supported, global
`~/.agents/skills` is scanned with the vendor-specific root, and duplicate
same-agent, same-scope identities are merged. These inputs are current state,
never historical exposure, and malformed, dynamic, plugin, unsupported, or
capped inputs block clean.

Report-time token estimates (`insights/report.rs::token_cost` and
`TokenBurnTurnEvidence`), old-model remediation savings, and provider-limit
attribution all read `turn.cache_write_1h_tokens` and price that subset at
two times the input rate. These readers are report-time views of turn rows,
not part of `SessionEvidence`, so the evidence schema revision does not
change when this pricing split changes.

Thread attribution retains at most 16,384 distinct UUIDs, each at most 256 bytes.
An overflow or oversized UUID records `CapExceeded`, makes attribution
incomplete, and blocks every clean result that needs complete affected evidence.
An oversized resume identity set is rejected instead of being trusted.

Codex pairs `token_usage_record` and `event_msg`/`token_count` records once.
Matching per-response and nonempty cumulative usage identifies exact copies
without a time limit. Different cumulative producer bases require matching
per-response usage within five seconds. Available identities distinguish
same-format requests. The reader retains bounded state across resume boundaries.
Unmatched valid usage remains evidence; malformed usage remains partial.

Cache accounting compares usage-bearing requests across ordinary Codex assistant
messages. Broken links, unknown requests, route changes, and compaction boundaries
still break pairs. The paid denominator includes every eligible request,
including each segment's initial payment. Partial cache or repeated-context
evidence permits neither a ratio finding nor a clean result.

Maintainer confirmation (2026-09-12): repair delayed exact-copy deduplication,
request pairing, and full-denominator accounting. Reviewed passive alternatives
include increasing the time limit and adjusting thresholds; neither repairs
all three accounting errors. Per-session thresholds remain unchanged.

Maintainer confirmation (2026-09-10): raise the identity cap to 16,384 as an
interim measure for longer sessions. Reviewed passive alternatives include
indexed local relationship queries and bounded batch processing. Those
alternatives remain outside this change; sessions above the cap still lose
clean-result eligibility. Analyzer revision 22 reprocesses prior evidence.

Skills mean full documents injected into model context. Listings, installed
skills, and names in tool calls do not prove unused document overhead. Resource
identity is retained without copying private document bodies into evidence.

| Quota pressure and provider incidents sit outside the nine-code check     |
| contract (FR-15): neither has a row in the Checks table above, and each   |
| reports only when transcripts carry its own evidence. `CodexRolloutJsonl` |
| and `ClaudeJsonl` both supply quota and provider incidents.               |

`CodexRolloutJsonl`: an `event_msg`/`task_complete` record with a non-null
`error` object maps to one of the two groups, against the pinned
`openai/codex` protocol commit
[`e7637306bc9246a3e42e407cb94f96b7ed345e3e`][codex-source] and a synthetic
fixture (`task_complete_errors.jsonl`):

- `quota_incidents`, a `QuotaIncident`, from `rate_limit_exceeded`
  (`RateLimit`) and `usage_limit_exceeded` (`UsageLimit`) — both name a
  user-allocation limit the reader's own usage caused.
- `provider_incidents`, a `ProviderIncident`, from `server_overloaded`
  (`Capacity`), `internal_server_error` (`ServerError`), and the four
  transport struct-variant codes `http_connection_failed`,
  `response_stream_connection_failed`, `response_stream_disconnected`, and
  `response_too_many_failed_attempts` by their `http_status_code`: `5xx`
  maps to `ServerError`, an absent or `null` status maps to `Connection`,
  and any other status is ignored because the retry wrapper hides which
  layer produced it.

Every other Codex code (`context_window_exceeded`, `session_budget_exceeded`,
`cyber_policy`, `misalignment_policy_violation`, `unauthorized`,
`bad_request`, `sandbox_error`, `active_turn_not_steerable`,
`thread_rollback_failed`, `other`) is ignored.

`ClaudeJsonl`: a `type: "assistant"` record with `isApiErrorMessage: true`
maps to one of the two groups from its `apiErrorStatus` (an HTTP status,
present only for a response the provider returned) and `error` (Claude
Code's own coarser classification), reviewed against harness version
`2.1.270` and a synthetic fixture (`api_error_records.jsonl`):

- `quota_incidents`, a `QuotaIncident` (`RateLimit`, `HardHit`), from status
  `429` or, when no status is present, `error: "rate_limit"`.
- `provider_incidents`, a `ProviderIncident`, from status `529` (`Capacity`),
  another `5xx` status (`ServerError`), or, when no status is present,
  `error: "server_error"` (`ServerError`).

A Claude quota incident also carries the limit family and the reset time the
record states in its message text. A `session limit` text gives
`RollingWindow` and a `weekly limit` text gives `Weekly`; a text neither
phrase matches stays `RateLimit`, because `apiErrorStatus` alone still proves
the refusal. The stated reset becomes a `QuotaResetClock` — an hour, a minute,
and the named zone — not an instant: the engine holds no zone database, so the
application resolves the clock. The reader keeps the two parsed values and
drops the text; no message text is stored. Evidence written before this field
existed deserializes with no clock.

Every other status or `error` value is ignored, including `error: "unknown"`
with no status (Claude's connection-refused case) and every 4xx other than 429. `ProviderIncidentKind::Connection` is Codex-only: no Claude field
reviewed so far identifies a connection failure without reading message
text.

Clean or absence is never claimed from either group for any source: each
section is not assessed without at least one observed incident of its own
kind, per FR-15's one condition.

Maintainer confirmation (2026-09-14): extend provider incidents with
`ServerError` and `Connection`, map Codex's remaining transport/server
`codex_error_info` codes, and add Claude `isApiErrorMessage` records as a
new quota/provider incident source. Reviewed passive alternatives:

- Classifying Claude errors from `content[].text` — rejected: free text and
  unpinned. The reader parses the limit family and the reset clock from an
  `isApiErrorMessage` text and keeps neither the text nor any other message
  text.
- Mapping Claude `error: "unknown"` to `Connection` — rejected: the label
  covers more than connection failures.
- Mapping non-5xx `http_status_code` values inside Codex transport
  variants — rejected: the retry wrapper hides which layer produced the
  status.
- Mapping `context_window_exceeded` / `session_budget_exceeded` — rejected:
  these name the user's own context or budget, a different failure class.
- Splitting Claude 429s into `UsageLimit` vs `RateLimit` from
  `quotaLimits` — deferred: no synthetic fixture has been characterised for
  that field yet.

| Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi | C | Durable request provider/API fields and the compatible-request query select reviewed cache-write or uncached-input accounting. A finding additionally needs a same-route hit/miss/recovery episode after the route's reviewed cache lifetime: Claude Code uses its configured one-hour default; Pi and OpenCode Anthropic routes use five minutes unless an earlier write records one-hour TTL evidence, which carries across hits and refreshes at hit request start; reviewed OpenAI routes use 30 minutes. OpenCode continuity uses validated consecutive order and distinct message IDs because `parentID` identifies the answered user, not the predecessor. Main-thread identity, order, token classes, model, route, and compaction boundaries constrain pairs. Codex pairs `token_usage_record` with equivalent `token_count` usage by per-response fields; matching cumulative fields permit delayed exact copies. Unknown or incompatible segments prevent findings and clean results. Google cache policy remains unreviewed. |
| OpenCode | C | Both accepted export and SQLite shapes use validated ordered history. `parentID` identifies the user being answered, not the predecessor. Missing wrappers/timestamps, duplicate or out-of-order messages, and unresolved forks prevent complete history. CoreV2 `session_message` is not the existing SQLite table contract. |
| Cursor | D, O | O retains direct timed-model findings; the source gate denies clean on every surface. D remains unavailable because the current reader does not emit request-usage evidence. Synthetic source-gate tests do not establish native parsing support. |
| Cursor | T, S, M, B, K, F, C | Broader surface characterization is deferred. Current settings, relations, inventories, and cache evidence remain partial, unknown, or unsupported as listed; no new parity claim is made. |
| Antigravity | D, O | Brain/cascade steps and native SQLite preserve direct usage/model findings where present. Missing model/time is not filled from an earlier step or an invented database timestamp. Private identity, enum, and completeness gaps deny clean. |
| Antigravity | T, S, M, B, K, F, C | Confirmed unsupported in the reviewed native evidence. Token classes do not establish compatible request linkage or cache cause. Runtime descriptors and unproved relationship sidecars do not establish persisted delegation, controls, or resource exposure. Workspace chat remains uncharacterized. |

M automatic remediation accepts only one named, enabled target with indexed
provenance and an exact current editor resolution. Codex resolves exactly one
active trusted project or global `mcp_servers.<name>` table. Claude resolves
exactly one standard project or global MCP source and adds only its matching
deny rule to one same-scope existing settings file. OpenCode has an exact
`enabled = false` editor, but M remains prompt-only when indexed provenance or
one exact current control is unavailable.
Antigravity has no public source and precedence proof for one persisted disable
field. Cursor MCP remediation is unavailable and never reads a private toggle
store or invokes a CLI command.

Cache churn selects its policy from `RepeatedContextAccounting`, not from the
agent or the session's dominant model. `CacheWrite` uses the reviewed Claude
family policy. `UncachedInput` uses the reviewed OpenAI family policy. This rule
also applies to mixed-family sessions. A cache-churn cause names a model from the
same accounting family; it does not use an unrelated dominant model. Repeated
input totals remain available even when there is no actionable episode. A
continuous-activity hit/miss/recovery episode is informational and leaves a
high-ratio result not assessed. A finding requires recovered cache use after a
supported route-specific user inactivity interval. Unknown routes, missing
timestamps, broken identity, compaction, model changes, and unrecovered misses
cannot establish that finding or a clean result.

Old-model causes remain separate by provider, API, observed model, and reviewed
replacement. Token-burn percentages are unknown when a required price or the
total-token denominator is absent. The estimator does not use a 10 percent
fallback and does not force a positive minimum.

## Passive Verification

Every T, O, or F finding with supported positive verification from a winning
`Ready` evidence publication can create one passive attempt, up to 100 attempts
per publication. Candidate filtering applies the detector, agent, source-format,
physical-target, and non-resource requirements before bounded selection. The
selection is fair across all nine detectors. V45 does not backfill old published
rows. The immutable boundary is the publication time in milliseconds, not the
session time. Replay reuses an active target. After recurrence, a later
publication can create a new attempt. A later action keeps a separate action
attempt for the same target; it does not replace the passive attempt or move its
boundary. Attempt creation, dirtying, evidence publication, and fenced row
replacement share the winning transaction.

The table below is the exact implemented positive-proof matrix. `Supported`
means the current backend can verify a fixed transition. `Unavailable` means it
does not enroll a passive attempt and cannot prove the initial fix from the
accepted passive evidence. An explicit action can store
`verificationUnavailable`. Source coverage from the main matrix still applies.

Truncated assessment sets, sessions that start at or before the boundary,
missing controls, changed detector or catalog policy, stale projections, and
unsupported source contracts return verification unavailable or continue
watching. They never become fixed through generic absence. For T and F, one
complete later session must contain the exact positive control for the same
target. For O, one later session must contain actual replacement-model use for
the same attributed target. Report-level absence and historical counts do not
verify a fix. A fixed supported target recurs only on a later exact positive
observation. Prior contributions end at the recurrence boundary and remain
durable.

The engine verifier is fail-closed for M/B/K. Historical session subsets are
always unavailable, whether they contain or omit the target. Only a complete,
bounded later current inventory with matching agent, source, scope, and use
coverage could verify absence or recurrence. No production desktop path supplies
that inventory to a watch today, so reachable M/B/K verification is unavailable.
Their stored resource selector cannot use model proof, establish report clean,
or create verified savings.

A successful M/B/K Auto Fix retains only the crash-safe write record with
`verificationUnavailable`. The result is `applied_verification_unavailable`, not
`applied_awaiting_verification`, and the UI does not move the check into the
awaiting-verification group.

## Automatic Editor Support

`Auto Fix` means the backend can bind a finding to one effective physical
setting, prepare a reviewed edit, and recover an uncertain write. Resource Auto
Fix additionally requires indexed provenance and an exact current resource,
scope, value, and physical key. `Prompt only` means the existing bounded prompt
can describe the finding, but the backend cannot prove one safe physical edit.
Source versions mean the accepted source shapes in the source inventory. No row
claims every historical agent release.

Each Auto Fix edits one winning control. An inherited value selects its global
or user control. A project target requires the exact explicit project setting or
resource; the editor never creates a project config. Scalar edits are not
batched across active layers. Findings from multiple projects that resolve to
the same global control form one target, and prepare and apply revalidate every
grouped project context. Model and reasoning edits remain pinned to the
publication-time scope and physical target.

The prompt matrix below comes from `remediation/prompts.rs`. A `Yes` still needs
one finding that passes the source coverage gates above.
The check-level Copy action can return bounded generic text for one or more
selectable current targets. It returns no prompt when no target is selectable.
Every returned prompt has one durable `ABR-` reference and each selected target
has a durable action attempt.

### Source-Format Remediation Matrix

This exact matrix lists every `SourceFormat` once. Check-code lists are typed
sets: `None` or slash-separated codes from D/T/S/M/B/K/O/F/C with no duplicates.
The rows describe reachable remediation, so a production recommendation without
a reachable finding is not listed. Auto Fix columns describe production policy;
each operation still needs an exact target binding at runtime.

The macOS and Linux implementation rejects unreviewed runtime overrides,
managed or system configuration, Codex profiles, untrusted workspaces,
unsupported precedence, unsupported missing files, duplicate definitions, malformed data,
files above 256 KiB, non-regular files, target or ancestor symlinks, and wrong
Unix owner or group. Apply re-resolves precedence, checks the original file
identity and bytes, writes an exclusive same-directory temporary file,
preserves mode and owner/group, syncs it, atomically replaces the target, syncs
the directory, and performs typed readback. A changed target conflicts without
retargeting. The approved missing-file exception creates only global Claude
settings for an eligible optional built-in tool. It uses exclusive creation,
safe parent directories, directory sync, and exact-byte readback.

Native Windows can resolve and store publication-time attribution. Apply remains
unavailable because the repository has no reviewed implementation and executable
tests for ACL preservation, reparse points, sharing conflicts, Windows file
identity, replacement semantics, and uncertain-write recovery. The backend does
not create a prepared review on Windows. WSL has a separate environment key and
never reads or edits the native host configuration.

Prepared changes are memory-bounded and expire after ten minutes. A crash in
`writing` becomes durable `recoveryNeeded`. Recovery accepts only the same
native agent, accepted source format, scope, physical target, and replacement
value after fresh override and managed-policy checks. A changed target or an
unprovable result stays in recovery and does not start a second write.

## Config Attribution Contracts

Audit date: 2026-09-14. Attribution is publication-time metadata, not
historical session evidence. The backend stores a keyed physical target hash,
scope, observed value, physical path, selector, typed expected value, and a
keyed precedence identity only after complete control observations match the
resolved setting. This local data is not sent in analytics or diagnostics.

## Savings Contracts

All nine methods have typed inputs, methods, revisions, units, and unavailable
reasons. Known zero and negative values remain known. Missing evidence,
assumptions, comparisons, rates, revisions, or durable ownership remains
unknown. Arithmetic overflow is unknown, not a saturated saving.

| Check | Method                               | Result unit                                | Current numeric eligibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| D     | Repeated context above the depth cap | Literal input tokens                       | Numeric only with an observed request total and pinned cap. Confirmed accumulation is unavailable while D verification is unavailable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| T     | Reviewed output reduction assumption | Assumed output tokens                      | Requires observed output and an explicit basis-point assumption. No default assumption exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| S     | Worker model price difference        | API-equivalent USD                         | Requires exact worker tokens, reviewed alternative rates, route, pricing revision, and ownership. Missing inputs remain unknown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| M     | MCP definition exposure              | API-equivalent USD or literal input tokens | Requires attributable definition tokens and compatible-request count. Names or exposure alone are nonnumeric. Reports API-equivalent USD only when every contributing turn's model resolves in the live pricing table and the stamped pricing revision is still current; otherwise the finding still reports with literal input tokens and no dollar figure. |
| B     | Built-in definition replication      | API-equivalent USD or literal input tokens | Numeric for established catalog-backed replication counts. It is not converted into a confirmed win while B verification is unavailable. Same pricing-table and revision requirement as M applies for the API-equivalent USD figure; an unresolvable model still reports the token count.                                                                    |
| K     | Injected skill document              | API-equivalent USD or literal input tokens | Requires full document tokens and compatible-request count. Listings never qualify. Same pricing-table and revision requirement as M applies for the API-equivalent USD figure; an unresolvable model still reports the token count.                                                                                                                         |
| O     | Old-model price difference           | API-equivalent USD                         | Implemented for exact attributed Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi replacement activity with both reviewed rates and a pricing revision. Zero and negative differences remain known.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| F     | Fast-tier price premium              | API-equivalent USD                         | Requires same-model, same-route standard and fast rates, eligible tokens, pricing revision, and ownership. Missing comparisons remain unknown.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| C     | Paid versus cache-read difference    | API-equivalent USD                         | Requires attributable repeated paid tokens and reviewed paid/cache rates. Raw repeated tokens alone do not establish dollars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Literal input tokens, assumed output tokens, cache-class tokens,
API-equivalent USD, and improvement counts are separate units. Aggregation adds
only values with one nonempty durable owner, no duplicate owner, and one unit.
Mixed units and unresolved overlap stay separate. Confirmed contribution rows
contain bounded derived facts, replace equal or newer facts for one owner, and
survive normal session retention. Verification transition and contribution
replacement commit together. Aggregate reads return at most 1,000 newest rows.
Durable storage keeps at most 1,000 contribution rows and 1,000 closed attempt
rows. Active attempts remain until they verify or recur.

The stored estimated-savings value is the target's pre-remediation opportunity;
it is not recent usage. The aggregate-savings read returns only exact current
cycles that remain fixed, retain a fixed verification result and verified
boundary, match their stored finding snapshot, and are not actively snoozed.
The renderer additionally requires a visibly Passed detector and hides Savings
when no eligible cycle remains. Confirmed savings alone can use eligible
post-verification sessions.

The remediation backend lists current displayable findings even when no action
is safe. Prompt support follows the source and check limits in this document.
T and F prompt watches require fresh, complete post-boundary assessment and the
exact positive control described in the matrix before a fix can verify.
Old-model watches are stricter: only actual old or replacement model use
attributed to the same publication-time effective physical target, scope,
provider, and API can change the result. Other checks store
`verificationUnavailable`; generic absence cannot verify them. Positive-only
sources cannot verify absence, and missing later evidence remains `watching`.
An exact copied prompt remains outside verification until its opaque `ABR-`
reference appears in a later captured user message. The marker publication sets
the boundary and cannot prove the same attempt.

Cursor can use its explicit synthesized source-header model, but does not borrow
the previous message's model. This preserves existing basic support without
claiming native per-request completeness.

## Confirmation Ledger

The maintainer confirmed these source-scoped decisions on 2026-09-08. The
alternatives below were reviewed; none authorizes runtime collection or claims
future impossibility. Workspace/unknown shapes retain `Unknown` rather than
inheriting a native format's contract.

## Deferred Source Limits

These existing source classifications use dedicated fail-closed readers. Their
basic discovery remains supported, but none has an assessable detector-grade
contract. The matrix retains their prior source limits; `Partial` here does not
claim an implemented finding path.

| Source                             | Current boundary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Copilot CLI                        | Persisted event logs omit per-call usage and loaded inventories that the official schema marks transient. Model/effort changes, skill calls, and subagent configuration lack a complete request-level check contract. Configuration alone is not actual delegation. |
| Copilot IDE                        | Chat JSON can carry model names, but model/time and other check facts are uncharacterized. CLI contracts do not apply to IDE storage.                                                                                                                               |
| Cline                              | The characterized messages-contract-v1 bundle supports bounded delegated and model findings only. Calls and model names do not prove paired timing, historical resources, or other clean facts; legacy sources fail closed.                                         |
| Kiro canonical and chat            | Separate source shapes; resource definitions, exposure, calls, models, timing, and settings lack characterized detector-grade semantics. The fallback does not inherit canonical coverage.                                                                          |
| Amp thread                         | The characterized thread JSON supports bounded depth and model findings only. Saved routing modes do not prove actual model effort or speed; resources, timing, and accounting remain uncharacterized.                                                              |
| Amp file changes                   | Not a conversation session. No check can use file-change records as request, model, or inventory proof.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Windsurf workspace and mirror JSON | Calls and model names can exist, but complete resource, timing, control, and accounting semantics remain uncharacterized.                                                                                                                                           |
| Windsurf protobuf                  | Discovery recognizes Cascade paths; no bounded protobuf session parser or supported field contract exists.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Generic fallback                   | No native source contract. Recognized-looking JSON does not authorize detector-grade evidence or clean.                                                                                                                                                             |

## Coverage Promotion Rule

Change an entry to `Assessable` only when it can support both findings and clean
results. It needs all of these conditions:

- The accepted source shape is explicit through a schema, header, or pinned
  producer commit and synthetic fixtures. Record a release range when known.
- The reader emits every fact required for both a finding and a clean result.
- Missing, malformed, truncated, capped, or unknown records produce partial or unavailable evidence.
- Positive, negative, and incomplete synthetic fixtures exist.
- Full and resumed reads produce equivalent evidence where resume is supported.
- The model and provider policy is reviewed where the check needs policy.
- The implementation does not use current configuration as historical session evidence.

If a source cannot meet these conditions, keep the supported scope as `Partial`,
`Unsupported`, or `Unknown`. Do not convert missing evidence into a clean
result. Record the source limit and any separate source used for an advisory
assessment. The confirmation ledger records current reviewed decisions.

## Test Coverage

- Agent characterization suites in `crates/antiburn-local/tests/` cover native
  records, missing facts, scoped resources, provider controls, and malformed input.
- `resume_parity.rs`, `evidence_replay_parity.rs`, and `turn_row_replay_parity.rs`
