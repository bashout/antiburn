# Session Parsing Coverage

Audit date: 2026-09-16.

This document records how Antiburn discovers and parses local session sources.
It covers source identity, framing, companion data, normalized facts, and
provider-route extraction. See [`check-coverage.md`](check-coverage.md) for the
nine burn checks that can use those facts.

This is a living contract. A discovered path does not prove that its contents
are understood. A parsed field can support a scoped result without proving full
historical coverage.

## Status Rules

| Status          | Meaning                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Characterized   | Committed fixtures define the accepted source shape and important failure cases.                                |
| Partial         | The reader parses useful facts, but source shapes, versions, companions, or completeness rules still have gaps. |
| Uncharacterized | Discovery can identify the source, but no detector-grade parsing contract exists. The reader must fail closed.  |
| Not a session   | The discovered data does not contain a conversation session and must not inherit session coverage.              |

## Pipeline Contract

Every supported source passes through these boundaries:

1. Discovery identifies the agent, native source, surface, session identity, and companions.
2. Source validation pins the accepted file boundary or database snapshot.
3. The shell supplies `SessionInput.source_format`; `reader_for` selects the
   `SessionReader` by agent label, and the reader consumes that source contract.
4. Bounded framing rejects oversized, malformed, truncated, or unreadable records.
5. Parsing emits normalized metrics, content, and evidence observations.
6. The evidence sink records complete, partial, or unavailable facts.
7. The check contract decides whether a finding or clean result is valid.

Unknown changed evidence-bearing shapes must not fall through to a generic
interpretation that can produce clean. A known shape need not have a universal
release range: an accepted schema, header, or pinned producer commit with
synthetic fixtures can define its contract. This does not prove all historical
versions. Full and resumed reads must agree where resume is supported.

Codex pairs `token_usage_record` and `event_msg`/`token_count` records once.
Matching per-response and nonempty cumulative usage identifies exact copies
without a time limit. Different cumulative producer bases require matching
per-response usage within five seconds. Available identities distinguish
same-format requests. The reader retains bounded state across resume boundaries.
Unmatched valid usage remains evidence; malformed usage remains partial.

Cache accounting compares usage-bearing requests across ordinary Codex assistant
messages. Broken links, unknown requests, route changes, and compaction boundaries
still break pairs. The paid denominator includes every eligible request,
including each segment's initial payment. Partial cache or repeated-context
evidence permits neither a ratio finding nor a clean result.

Codex `thread_rolled_back` is an explicit request-history boundary. It is retained
as a compaction-boundary event so depth, cache accounting, metrics, and resumed
reads cannot join requests across the rollback.

Maintainer confirmation (2026-09-12): repair delayed exact-copy deduplication,
request pairing, and full-denominator accounting. Reviewed passive alternatives
include increasing the time limit and adjusting thresholds; neither repairs
all three accounting errors. Per-session thresholds remain unchanged.

Claude JSONL usage parses a nested `cache_creation` breakdown
(`ephemeral_1h_input_tokens`, `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens`) into
`cache_write_1h_tokens`, the subset of cache-creation tokens Anthropic bills
at the one-hour premium rate instead of the catalogue's default (five-minute)
rate. The flat `cache_creation_input_tokens` total takes the larger of itself
and the breakdown's sum; the one-hour count never exceeds that total. A
present breakdown always wins. Claude Code has run with one-hour caching
configured throughout, so a Claude record with no nested breakdown
classifies its whole cache-creation total as one-hour writes instead,
mirroring the cadence parser's own default for sessions that predate the
breakdown. Non-Claude sources carry no such default: an absent breakdown
there reports zero one-hour tokens.

Inline materialized sources use a fingerprint of the full bounded content, not
only a head region. The content is already materialized and size-bounded before
this fingerprint is calculated. OpenCode SQLite fingerprints stream every
selected value from the accepted root and descendant `session`, `message`, and
`part` cluster in stable table and row order. This detects a content change even
when row counts and saved timestamps do not change.

## Desktop Refresh

The desktop watcher requests a scoped refresh when a native source changes.
A metadata poll also checks active native file sessions every five seconds.
It compares file size and modification time because a writer can keep a file
open without a watcher notification. The poll waits fifteen seconds when no
native file session is active. It stops refresh work when discovery is paused.
Changed paths use the existing scoped refresh queue and admission limits.
The full scan remains the fallback for inactive files and WSL sources.
This changes refresh timing, not accepted source formats or check eligibility.

## Remote Copies

The Linux x64/ARM64 helper discovers only Claude Code and Codex and exports
their accepted `ClaudeJsonl` and `CodexRolloutJsonl` evidence. Remote support
does not add a source format or widen the producer/version contracts below.
The desktop distinguishes hosts with immutable IDs, analyzes explicitly located
private cache files, and keeps native and WSL discovery separate.

Each listing returns up to 200 supported sessions from seven days, ordered
newest first within the examined set. Entry, candidate, byte, and elapsed-time
budgets can truncate discovery before every candidate is examined. Listings skip
expired transcripts before preview reads. Codex exports use bounded first-record
reads to retain linked children even when a child's modification time is older
than the parent or the listing window.
Listing absence does not prove deletion. Exported transcript, child, fork-parent,
and supported sidecar inputs must pass the helper's association and
descriptor-relative admission checks. Symlink components and non-regular files
are rejected. An incomplete companion search cannot replace a cached bundle.
Missing or rejected companions remain unavailable or partial; the desktop must
not substitute this computer's files or current configuration. A synced session
is a cached copy, not evidence of current remote activity or local quota use.
See [remote sessions](remote-sessions.md) for setup, transfer bounds, and retention.

## Review Scope

The reviewed targets are OpenCode, Pi, Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity.
Their accepted source contracts and exact unsupported checks are recorded here
and in the [confirmation ledger](check-coverage.md#confirmation-ledger).
Cursor and other agents retain basic current support with broader work deferred.
Dedicated reader registration alone does not establish usable session analysis.

## Source Matrix

The table lists all 33 `SourceFormat` names from
`crates/antiburn-local/src/analysis/evidence.rs`, each exactly once.

Before a production session enters the local index, its CWD must resolve to a
Git repository. The scan maps linked worktrees to the canonical main root and
rejects missing or unresolved CWDs. A disabled repository is rejected when
either its CWD or its canonical root is in the existing ignored-path set.
Newly discovered repositories remain enabled by default.

The Claude API-error fixture also characterizes quota limit families and reset
clocks in `isApiErrorMessage` text. Session-limit and weekly-limit messages
retain their family, hour, minute, and named time zone without retaining the
message text. The desktop resolves the clock against the incident timestamp;
a missing or unusable reset does not erase the observed refusal. This shape
adds no clean-result eligibility. See the quota incident contract in
[check coverage](check-coverage.md).

## Provider Routes

Provider identity, API shape, and model identity are separate facts. A model
name alone does not establish option or accounting semantics.

Lifecycle execution metadata reads the provider and model from the same newest
published modeled turn. It keeps harness identity, recorded provider, canonical
route, and model-family vendor separate. Pi's `openai-codex` route normalizes to
`openai`; intermediary routes never become the model vendor. Missing or custom
routes do not use a harness or model fallback for HUD provider sweeps. This is a
consumer of existing durable evidence, not new parser or check coverage. See
[`session-lifecycle-events.md`](session-lifecycle-events.md#scoped-sweep-evidence).

Pi T uses `EffortSemantics::AgentSelectedPolicy`. Its saved level is not the
provider's final effort after model maps or overrides. Reviewed provider/API
pairs in `model_catalog.rs` are `openai` with `responses`, `openai-responses`,
or `openai-completions`; `openai-codex` with `openai-codex-responses`;
`anthropic` with `messages` or `anthropic-messages`; and `google` with
`generate-content` or `google-generative-ai`. Each still needs a reviewed model.
Google cache policy is not reviewed. Native API recognition does not authorize
custom providers or prove provider-translated effort.
Pi's above-cap effort evidence requires positive token usage on the same
model/effort observation. An explicitly zero-token empty aborted attempt is
ignored; missing usage leaves effort assessment incomplete and cannot produce a
finding or clean result.

OpenCode and Pi C use persisted provider/API fields in `TurnRow` and the shared
compatible-request query. Unknown routes, mixed accounting, missing linkage,
compactions, or incomplete history prevent clean. OpenCode uses validated
ordered history, not `parentID` as a fabricated predecessor link.

The route columns use engine turn migration 7 and desktop migration 39. Current
parser/analyzer/evidence/coverage/resume revisions are 39/25/22/6/11. Existing
revision gates invalidate old projections and snapshots; JSON and binary
evidence round trips and full/resumed replay are covered by tests.

Discovery carries the selected `SourceFormat` and surface identity with each
source descriptor. Readers use that metadata rather than reclassifying a raw
path after discovery. SQLite readers fingerprint rows visible through the live
connection, including uncheckpointed WAL rows, and compare again after a
transaction snapshot completes.

The evidence accumulator retains at most 16,384 distinct thread UUIDs. Each UUID
must be at most 256 bytes. A new UUID after the set is full, or an oversized
UUID, makes attribution incomplete and records `Partial(CapExceeded)`. Resume
deserialization rejects an oversized set or UUID. Defensive reconstruction also
caps invalid in-memory resume state and keeps the evidence partial.
The retained evidence memory ceiling is 8 MiB per accumulator. A synthetic
16,384-record linked chain with maximum-length identities verifies complete
coverage and resume round trips within that ceiling.

Current configuration can support a current-state assessment of a model,
compaction setting, or resource inventory. It cannot prove what a historical
request exposed unless the session records the inputs needed to select that
catalog entry. Keep current-state and historical claims separate.

The desktop also has a bounded read-only advisory resource inventory for native
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Cline, OpenCode, Kiro, Amp, Antigravity,
and Devin/Windsurf contexts. It returns logical MCP server and skill candidates
with current enabled state, global or project scope, provenance, and explicit
limits. It returns no path, selector, writable target, or historical exposure.
A displayed unused resource also needs a supporting failed session. Skill
candidates can carry a proportional estimate for listing frontmatter only. The
body is not read for the estimate. This inventory is not session evidence.

The reviewed current inputs are standard Claude user and project MCP files,
`.claude/skills`, skill overrides, and exact permission controls; trusted Codex
user and project `mcp_servers` layers plus `.agents/skills` and compatibility
`.codex/skills`; OpenCode JSON/JSONC `mcp` and `mcp.servers` shapes, standard
skill roots, `tools`, and permission controls; and Pi `defaultTools`, standard
skill roots, explicit non-pattern skill directories, and
`pi-mcp-extension` 1.5.0. Copilot uses `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, project
`.mcp.json`, and `.github/mcp.json` with its top-level `servers` map. Cline uses
its reviewed MCP settings and canonical skill roots. These are current-state
inputs, not historical session evidence. Pi MCP activation additionally requires an installed
manifest with the exact package name, version, and `./src/index.ts` extension.
Its reviewed producer is commit
`8a01fc53f3289d2e8eb492d67ba45cd84d64e7f2`.

Known candidates survive malformed or dynamic unrelated inputs. The inventory
records those inputs as limits. Indexed `SessionEvidence` can add observed MCP,
skill, and catalog-backed built-in candidates, including candidates from a
partial observed subset. It never turns that subset into current enablement or
historical completeness.

The native 30-day report reduction now builds a separate bounded resource
assessment. It reads positive use from tool counts, invoked loaded sources,
catalog-backed tool definitions, and persisted initial-context source rows.
Positive facts from partial evidence can suppress an exact candidate. Partial
evidence cannot prove non-use or a clean result. The reducer retains at most
4,096 distinct positive-use identities, 4,096 resource turn groups, 4,096
measured resource-session entries, 512 candidates and unused targets per
detector, three supporting sessions per target, 256 repository roots, and 256
distinct agent, working-directory, and repository inventory contexts. A cap
blocks clean but does not remove retained findings.

Global use applies only to the same agent. Project use applies only to the
canonical accessible repository root selected by longest path containment.
Unknown source origin does not create a scoped fallback target. When a raw call
has no source origin, a same-name project candidate in that repository takes
precedence over the global candidate. Same-name resources in different scopes
or repositories remain separate.

The pinned positive identities are case-insensitive exact resource names;
`mcp__<server>__<tool>` for Claude Code and Codex; `<server>_<tool>` for
OpenCode; and the default `mcp_<sanitized-server>_<tool>` shape from
`pi-mcp-extension` 1.5.0. Claude Code and Codex additionally accept one unique
bare suffix for a namespaced skill and the final segment of a catalog-backed
built-in alias. Ambiguous skill aliases suppress every possible matching target
and block clean. An ambiguous OpenCode or Pi MCP call suppresses all possible matching server
findings and blocks clean without counting a server as used. OpenCode and Pi use
exact skill and built-in identities.

The Checks payload and target action command use this assessment for M/B/K
status, counts, named targets, and estimates. Skill listings replicate only the
frontmatter estimate across applicable turns. MCP estimates require measured
indexed definition tokens. Built-in estimates use measured Claude Code and
Codex definitions or pinned OpenCode and Pi catalog captures. Measured resource
attribution is preferred. When a category has findings but measured attribution,
its denominator, or arithmetic is unavailable, the report uses the detector's
bounded finding-rate fallback. This is an estimated workload share, not measured
tokens or price evidence. Zero findings never create a fallback.

Resource Auto Fix requires both indexed provenance and one exact current editor
resolution for the same agent, name, kind, scope, value, and physical key.
Inventory-only and unresolved targets remain prompt-only. Exact M/B/K prompts do
create durable action attempts and references. Copying leaves the check Failing;
marker activation makes it Awaiting even though verification and savings remain
unavailable. A successful resource Auto Fix keeps a crash-recovery record whose
verification and savings states are unavailable. It does not claim that later
evidence will verify the change.

Historical session subsets cannot verify M/B/K absence or recurrence. The
engine accepts only a complete, bounded later current inventory with matching
agent, source, scope, and use coverage. The desktop remediation assessment path
currently supplies historical subsets, not that inventory, so M/B/K
verification is unavailable in the product.

For native sessions, the desktop can add nullable model and reasoning remediation
metadata when it publishes `Ready` evidence. This applies to `ClaudeJsonl`,
`CodexRolloutJsonl`, `OpenCodeJsonl`, `OpenCodeSqliteV2`, and `PiV3Jsonl` as the
vendor matrix allows. It hashes the physical setting and saves the effective
scope and value only when complete model evidence matches the effective setting.
Claude Code and Codex require their reviewed fixed routes. OpenCode and Pi
require the saved provider and model route. Reasoning also requires the exact
saved level. Codex project attribution requires explicit trust and resolves
reviewed `.codex/config.toml` layers from the repository root through the
session CWD. Untrusted workspaces and unsupported precedence store no
attribution. Native Windows can store attribution but cannot apply a change.
WSL stores no native attribution. This metadata describes publication-time
configuration. It is not session evidence or historical truth.

Model and reasoning Auto Fix remains pinned to this publication-time scope and
physical target. Current resolution must match both before prepare and apply.
An inherited setting therefore edits its global or user winner, while an exact
explicit project setting edits that project winner. Scalar controls are not
batched across layers. Findings from different projects group when they resolve
to the same global target, and every grouped project context is revalidated.
The editor never creates a project config.

Fast-mode remediation does not use publication-time configuration attribution.
It needs explicit persisted fast-tier session evidence and an existing current
winning Claude `fastMode = true` or Codex `service_tier = "fast"` target. Model
names, variants, labels, and latency do not qualify. Claude writes
`fastMode = false` to the one winning control rather than removing the key.

The resolver rejects runtime, environment, managed, remote, dynamic,
split-route, malformed, and ambiguous winners. Cursor and Antigravity
configuration remains separate from their accepted session contracts, so it
cannot attribute a historical setting. See the
[config attribution contracts](check-coverage.md#config-attribution-contracts).

K remediation uses the finding's exact skill identity and complete invocation
coverage. Current accepted sources do not retain a durable skill path. The
editor therefore derives a path only when one current standard `SKILL.md`
definition wins under the vendor's documented configuration roots. A missing or
ambiguous definition makes Auto Fix unavailable. The edit changes only the
vendor control and never deletes or changes `SKILL.md`.

Claude B remediation uses one exact optional web-search tool name. A project
target requires the bare canonical name in that project's exact
`permissions.allow` array. Otherwise an inherited tool resolves to global
settings. This is the only approved remediation path that can create a missing
global config, and it never creates a project config. This editor behavior does
not expand the accepted `ClaudeJsonl` history or B finding eligibility.

The winning evidence-publication transaction now enrolls at most 100 exact
passive T, O, and F findings. Enrollment starts only after desktop schema V45 is installed;
the V45 migration does not scan or infer attempts from older evidence. The
publication time in milliseconds is the immutable verification boundary, so a
historical session first published after rollout cannot become a retroactive
win. A losing claim publishes no attempt. A replay reuses the active durable
target and does not move its boundary. This work reads the bounded published
evidence and normalized turn rows. It does not read prompts, target-list state,
or window state, and it does not add a source scanner.

When no trusted workspace identifies a target, the remediation fallback scope
hash includes both the agent and session ID. Equal session IDs from different
agents cannot share a fallback target identity.

The evidence worker alternates ready evidence and remediation work when both
queues have work. Each publication and verification pass keeps its existing
bound. A winning publication can inspect its normalized user-content rows for a
bounded exact remediation marker. This activates only the matching copied-prompt
attempt at the publication boundary. It does not retain markers in evidence,
analytics, diagnostics, or derived finding facts. Restart recovery uses the
database rows; it does not rescan retained or deleted transcripts to reconstruct
attempts or contributions.

## Known Contract Gaps

- OpenCode WSL discovery launches the OpenCode executable for bounded metadata
  queries and session export. This is supported discovery, but it is not
  disk-only passive file access and does not establish a normal persisted-store
  contract for a new source format.
- Cursor store and IDE synthesis drops structured calls, arguments, usage,
  settings, and relation fields that can exist in native records.
- Antigravity private protobuf parsing does not yet preserve stable request
  identity, numeric model enums, retry meaning, provider boundaries, or
  compaction semantics.
- No current M/B/K reader proves a full historical inventory. Observed subset
  completeness plus complete calls can support scoped findings, not clean. B
  Auto Fix uses the Claude Code source only when the finding provides one exact
  canonical tool name. The advisory inventory has no mutation path. The report
  and action integration can select an Auto Fix target only when indexed
  provenance and the existing exact mutation resolver identify the same current
  resource, scope, value, and physical key. Other targets remain prompt-only.
- Selected OpenCode skills and Codex skill documents are observed injection and
  invocation, not unused listing overhead. Claude M/K also remain subset-scoped.
- OpenCode CoreV2 `session_message` is not the current `OpenCodeSqliteV2` table
  contract. Pinned schema research does not add a production reader.
- OpenCode variants have no historical effort map. Pi policy is characterized
  as agent-selected, not translated provider effort.
- Cursor permits direct O findings; Antigravity permits D/O findings where
  facts exist. Both deny clean by source gate. Neither borrows a previous record's model/time;
  Cursor retains its explicit synthesized header-model behavior.
- Generic and fail-closed readers must not promote recognized-looking fields to
  detector-grade evidence.

## Pinned First-Tier Sources

- Claude Code main JSONL fields and the child sidecar are private. The accepted
  record subset is pinned to the public 2.1.220-2.1.246 observation contract in
  [cclens][claude-session-source]. The main transcript and `.meta.json` are
  separate contracts. A missing sidecar, missing worker model, ambiguous join,
  or unknown evidence-bearing record blocks clean results.
- Codex rollout rows are pinned to the public recorder at
  [`e7637306`][codex-recorder-source]. The source writes `session_meta`,
  `turn_context`, `event_msg`, `response_item`, ordinals, and `compacted` rows.
  Synthetic fixtures cover accepted rows and loss paths. Persisted config is
  not treated as historical session evidence.
- Pi V3 is pinned to the public session-format document at
  [`b2602be7`][pi-session-source]. It defines `responseModel`,
  `providerThinkingLevel`, diagnostics, cache buckets, `id`/`parentId`, and
  the separate legacy `firstKeptEntryId` and newer retained-tail compaction
  forms. `providerThinkingLevel` is not agent-selected effort.
- Cursor's legacy CLI store and chat store use different contracts. The reviewed
  chat source uses `~/.cursor/chats/<workspace>/<session>/store.db`; both use
  only the reviewed `blobs` and `meta` subset.
  Neither source establishes an effective model fallback, inventory, route, or
  IDE configuration contract.
- Antigravity CLI SQLite is pinned to agy 1.0.16 reverse-engineering and the
  descriptor-backed field subset in ccusage. The reader admits only
  `user_version = 1`; it does not claim protobuf fields outside the tested
  usage, model, timestamp, retry, and identity subset.

## Update Rules

Update this document in the same change when any of these items changes:

- Agent discovery paths or source precedence.
- A `SourceFormat` variant or its classification rules.
- Framing, size limits, snapshot, streaming, or resume behavior.
- Parsed metrics, content, evidence, or unknown-record behavior.
- Companion discovery, pairing, fingerprinting, or ownership.
- Provider, API, model, option, or accounting extraction.
- Characterization fixtures or supported version ranges.

Update [`check-coverage.md`](check-coverage.md) in the same change when the
parsing change affects a check's finding, clean, partial, or unavailable state.

## Coverage Promotion Rule

A source is `Characterized` when it can support its documented scope. A source
is complete for clean results only when:

- Its source path and accepted shape are explicit through a schema, header, or
  pinned producer commit plus synthetic fixtures; release ranges are recorded
  where known.
- Discovery reaches the production reader with the expected `SourceFormat`.
- Framing and snapshot behavior are bounded and fail closed.
- Every contributing companion is paired and fingerprinted.
- Positive, negative, incomplete, malformed, and unknown-shape fixtures exist.
- Full and resumed reads are equivalent where resume is supported.
- Provider and model semantics are reviewed where parsing exposes controls or accounting.
- The corresponding rows in `check-coverage.md` match tested behavior.

Use `Partial` for a safe scoped result. Use `Uncharacterized` when the reader
does not support a claim. Agent characterization, resume, replay, and desktop
companion tests check behavior separately. The
[confirmation ledger](check-coverage.md#confirmation-ledger) records reviewed
source limits.
