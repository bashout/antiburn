/**
 * Filling the presentation layer's agent-icon slot.
 *
 * The presentation components take a `renderAgentIcon` slot and never ship
 * artwork; the registry in `lib/presentation/agents` resolves a slug to an
 * icon *name*, not an asset. This module answers that slot with three tiers:
 *
 * 1. **A brand mark** with recorded provenance — licensed path data,
 *    verified against each icon's recorded source so a name collision cannot
 *    smuggle in the wrong brand. `simple-icons` supplies all but one (its
 *    `AMP` is Google's web framework, not the Amp agent, so Amp deliberately
 *    has no entry here, and its only OpenAI-adjacent icon is the discontinued
 *    `OpenAI Gym`); OpenAI's mark comes from `lib/brandMarks`, which carries
 *    its own provenance and a test pinning it to its source. Antigravity uses
 *    the monochrome silhouette from its product asset.
 * 2. **A letter tile** for known agents without a usable mark (Kiro, Amp):
 *    the display name's initial in a small rounded tile,
 *    the same treatment the provider glyphs use.
 * 3. **A surface glyph** for `generic-agent` — terminal for CLI, editor panel
 *    for IDE, neutral mark otherwise — since an unknown agent has no name to
 *    draw.
 *
 * Colour follows the same evidence rule as the artwork. Most marks render in
 * the theme's brand-mark ink (`--color-agent-mark`) so the set reads as one
 * set in both themes; a mark whose identity *is* its colour opts into
 * {@link BRAND_COLORED} and renders in the hex the package records for it,
 * never a hex chosen here. Use is nominative — identifying which vendor's
 * agent produced a session.

/**
 * Marks that render in their brand's own hex rather than the theme ink.
 *
 * The bar is that the colour carries the identity — Claude's clay orange is
 * as much the mark as its shape, and flattening it to ink loses the brand
 * rather than unifying it. Everything else stays ink, because a row of eleven
 * competing brand colours reads as noise and several vendor hexes are
 * near-black or near-white, so they vanish in one theme or the other.
 *
 * The value is always the mark's recorded `hex`, never a hex written here, so
