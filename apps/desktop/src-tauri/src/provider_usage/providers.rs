//! Which provider a session's tokens were bought from.
//!
//! # The question this module answers
//!
//! "Provider" here means **who the reader pays**, not which laboratory trained
//! the weights. Those are the same thing for Claude Code (Anthropic bills the
//! Claude Code subscription or the API key behind it) and different for Cursor
//! (Cursor bills the subscription, whatever model it routes to). Attributing a
//! Cursor session's Claude tokens to Anthropic would imply money that changed
//! hands with Anthropic when it did not, so the mapping follows the billing
//! relationship.
//!
//! # Two kinds of agent
//!
//! - **Fixed route.** The agent's vendor is billed no matter which model ran:
//!   Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Antigravity, Windsurf, Amp, Kiro.
//!   The model evidence is not consulted, because it cannot change the answer.
//! - **Bring-your-own route.** The reader attaches their own provider account,
//!   so the *model* names the provider: Cline, OpenCode, Pi. A session that
//!   switched models mid-way is split across providers, one bucket per model.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not inferred
//!
//! A gateway (OpenRouter aside, which bills directly and is therefore named)
//! or a cloud reseller — Bedrock, Vertex, Azure — changes who is billed without
//! changing the model name, and a local transcript does not record which was
//! used. Those resolve to [`UNKNOWN`] rather than to a guess. The same applies
//! to a Claude Code install pointed at Bedrock: the fixed route says Anthropic,
//! which is the documented default, and no local evidence contradicts it.
//!
//! This conservatism is why the aggregation never emits a `live` state. Naming
//! a provider is an inference; a provider's *allowance* is not something a
//! session transcript can know at all.
